abstract = {The problem of temporal data clustering is addressed using a dynamic Gaussian mixture model. In addition to the missing clusters used in the classical Gaussian mixture model, the proposed approach assumes that the means of the Gaussian densities are latent variables distributed according to random walks. The parameters of the proposed algorithm are estimated by the maximum likelihood approach. However, the EM algorithm cannot be applied directly due to the complex structure of the model, and some approximations are required. Using a variational approximation, an algorithm called VEM-DyMix is proposed to estimate the parameters of the proposed model. Using simulated data, the ability of the proposed approach to accurately estimate the parameters is demonstrated. VEM-DyMix outperforms, in terms of clustering and estimation accuracy, other state-of-the-art algorithms. The experiments performed on real world data from two fields of application (railway condition monitoring and object tracking from videos) show the strong potential of the proposed algorithms.},

abstract = {With the development of computer network bandwidth, packet classification algorithms which are able to deal with large-scale rule sets are in urgent need. Among the existing algorithms, researches on packet classification algorithms based on hierarchical trie have become an important packet classification research branch because of their widely practical use. Although hierarchical trie is beneficial to save large storage space, it has several shortcomings such as the existence of backtracking and empty nodes. This paper proposes a new packet classification algorithm, Hierarchical Trie Algorithm Based on Expectation-Maximization Clustering (HTEMC). Firstly, this paper uses the formalization method to deal with the packet classification problem by means of mapping the rules and data packets into a two-dimensional space. Secondly, this paper uses expectation-maximization algorithm to cluster the rules based on their aggregate characteristics, and thereby diversified clusters are formed. Thirdly, this paper proposes a hierarchical trie based on the results of expectation-maximization clustering. Finally, this paper respectively conducts simulation experiments and real-environment experiments to compare the performances of our algorithm with other typical algorithms, and analyzes the results of the experiments. The hierarchical trie structure in our algorithm not only adopts trie path compression to eliminate backtracking, but also solves the problem of low efficiency of trie updates, which greatly improves the performance of the algorithm.},

@article{Dreo2014,
abstract = {Here we report on the first assessment of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for detection and absolute quantification of two quarantine plant pathogenic bacteria that infect many species of the Rosaceae and Solanaceae families: Erwinia amylovora and Ralstonia solanacearum. An open-source R script was written for the ddPCR data analysis. Analysis of a set of samples with known health status aided the assessment and selection of different threshold settings (QuantaSoft analysis, definetherain pipeline and manual threshold), which led to optimal diagnostic specificity. The interpretation of the E. amylovora ddPCR was straightforward, and the analysis approach had little influence on the final results and the concentrations determined. The sensitivity and linear range were similar to those for real-time PCR (qPCR), for the analysis of both bacterial suspensions and plant material, making ddPCR a viable choice when both detection and quantification are desired. With the R. solanacearum ddPCR, the use of a high global threshold was necessary to exclude false-positive reactions that are sometimes observed in healthy plant material. ddPCR significantly improved the analytical sensitivity over that of qPCR, and improved the detection of low concentrations of R. solanacearum in potato tuber samples. Accurate and rapid absolute quantification of both of these bacteria in pure culture was achieved by direct ddPCR. Our data confirm the suitability of these ddPCR assays for routine detection and quantification of plant pathogens and for preparation of defined in-house reference materials with known target concentrations.},

@article{Whale2013,
abstract = {Digital PCR (dPCR) is a highly accurate molecular approach, capable of precise measurements, offering a number of unique opportunities. However, in its current format dPCR can be limited by the amount of sample that can be analysed and consequently additional considerations such as performing multiplex reactions or pre-amplification can be considered. This study investigated the impact of duplexing and pre-amplification on dPCR analysis by using three different assays targeting a model template (a portion of the Arabidopsis thaliana alcohol dehydrogenase gene). We also investigated the impact of different template types (linearised plasmid clone and more complex genomic DNA) on measurement precision using dPCR. We were able to demonstrate that duplex dPCR can provide a more precise measurement than uniplex dPCR, while applying pre-amplification or varying template type can significantly decrease the precision of dPCR. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the pre-amplification step can introduce measurement bias that is not consistent between experiments for a sample or assay and so could not be compensated for during the analysis of this data set. We also describe a model for estimating the prevalence of molecular dropout and identify this as a source of dPCR imprecision. Our data have demonstrated that the precision afforded by dPCR at low sample concentration can exceed that of the same template post pre-amplification thereby negating the need for this additional step. Our findings also highlight the technical differences between different templates types containing the same sequence that must be considered if plasmid DNA is to be used to assess or control for more complex templates like genomic DNA. {\textcopyright} 2013 Whale et al.},

abstract = {Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) provides the most sensitive measurement of residual infection in patients on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has recently been shown to provide highly accurate quantification of DNA copy number, but its application to quantification of HIV DNA, or other equally rare targets, has not been reported. This paper demonstrates and analyzes the application of ddPCR to measure the frequency of total HIV DNA (pol copies per million cells), and episomal 2-LTR (long terminal repeat) circles in cells isolated from infected patients. Analysis of over 300 clinical samples, including over 150 clinical samples assayed in triplicate by ddPCR and by real-time PCR (qPCR), demonstrates a significant increase in precision, with an average 5-fold decrease in the coefficient of variation of pol copy numbers and a {\textgreater}20-fold accuracy improvement for 2-LTR circles. Additional benefits of the ddPCR assay over qPCR include absolute quantification without reliance on an external standard and relative insensitivity to mismatches in primer and probe sequences. These features make digital PCR an attractive alternative for measurement of HIV DNA in clinical specimens. The improved sensitivity and precision of measurement of these rare events should facilitate measurements to characterize the latent HIV reservoir and interventions to eradicate it.},

abstract = {Limiting dilution PCR has become an increasingly useful technique for the detection and quantification of rare species in a population, but the limit of detection and accuracy of quantification are largely determined by the number of reactions that can be analyzed. Increased throughput may be achieved by reducing the reaction volume and increasing processivity. We have designed a high-throughput microfluidic chip that encapsulates PCR reagents in millions of picoliter droplets in a continuous oil flow. The oil stream conducts the droplets through alternating denaturation and annealing zones, resulting in rapid (55-s cycles) and efficient PCR amplification. Inclusion of fluorescent probes in the PCR reaction mix permits the amplification process to be monitored within individual droplets at specific locations within the microfluidic chip. We show that amplification of a 245-bp adenovirus product can be detected and quantified in 35 min at starting template concentrations as low as 1 template molecule/167 droplets (0.003 pg/$\mu$L). The frequencies of positive reactions over a range of template concentrations agree closely with the frequencies predicted by Poisson statistics, demonstrating both the accuracy and sensitivity of this platform for limiting dilution and digital PCR applications. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Diagnostics based on circulating circular RNA (circRNA) is an emerging field for noninvasive molecular diagnosis, owing to the stable circular structure of circRNA. However, the uniquely circular structure still poses a challenge for circRNA quantification in the research community. Here, we verified the discrepancy in the circRNA quantification by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and reverse transcription-droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (RT-ddPCR), which is caused by the rolling reverse transcription (RT) product originating from the circular structure. In addition, we detected the stability of cell-free circRNA in serum/plasma and determined the pre-analysis sampling procedure that will compromise the quantification of circRNA. Our results showed that prolonged RT incubation time resulted in multiple PCR products from circular RNA, which will reduce the accuracy of circRNA quantification by RT-qPCR technology, whereas ddPCR can address this limitation and could be a good alternative to qPCR for circRNA quantification. CircRNA showed a high stability in promptly separated serum/plasma but not in delay-separated samples.},

@article{Garriga2016,
abstract = {The growing capacity to process and store animal tracks has spurred the development of new methods to segment animal trajectories into elementary units of movement. Key challenges for movement trajectory segmentation are to (i) minimize the need of supervision, (ii) reduce computational costs, (iii) minimize the need of prior assumptions (e.g. simple parametrizations), and (iv) capture biologically meaningful semantics, useful across a broad range of species. We introduce the Expectation-Maximization binary Clustering (EMbC), a general purpose, unsupervised approach to multivariate data clustering. The EMbC is a variant of the Expectation-Maximization Clustering (EMC), a clustering algorithm based on the maximum likelihood estimation of a Gaussian mixture model. This is an iterative algorithm with a closed form step solution and hence a reasonable computational cost. The method looks for a good compromise between statistical soundness and ease and generality of use (by minimizing prior assumptions and favouring the semantic interpretation of the final clustering). Here we focus on the suitability of the EMbC algorithm for behavioural annotation of movement data. We show and discuss the EMbC outputs in both simulated trajectories and empirical movement trajectories including different species and different tracking methodologies. We use synthetic trajectories to assess the performance of EMbC compared to classic EMC and Hidden Markov Models. Empirical trajectories allow us to explore the robustness of the EMbC to data loss and data inaccuracies, and assess the relationship between EMbC output and expert label assignments. Additionally, we suggest a smoothing procedure to account for temporal correlations among labels, and a proper visualization of the output for movement trajectories. Our algorithm is available as an R-package with a set of complementary functions to ease the analysis.},

abstract = {Multi-angle total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (MA-TIRFM) is a new generation of TIRF microscopy to study cellular processes near dorsal cell membrane in 4 dimensions (3D+t). To perform quantitative analysis using MA-TIRFM, it is necessary to track subcellular particles in these processes. In this paper, we propose a method based on a MAP framework for automatic particle tracking and apply it to track clathrin coated pits (CCPs). The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to solve the MAP problem. To provide the initial estimations for the EM algorithm, we develop a forward filter based on the most probable trajectory (MPT) filter. Multiple linear models are used to model particle dynamics. For CCP tracking, we use two linear models to describe constrained Brownian motion and fluorophore variation according to CCP properties. The tracking method is evaluated on synthetic data and results show that it has high accuracy. The result on real data confirmed by human expert cell biologists is also presented.},

abstract = {Model-based clustering assumes that the data observed can be represented by a finite mixture model, where each cluster is represented by a parametric distribution. The Gaussian distribution is often employed in the multivariate continuous case. The identification of the subset of relevant clustering variables enables a parsimonious number of unknown parameters to be achieved, thus yielding a more efficient estimate, a clearer interpretation and often improved clustering partitions. This paper discusses variable or feature selection for model- based clustering. Following the approach of Raftery and Dean (J Am Stat Assoc 101(473):168–178, 2006), the problem of subset selection is recast as a model comparison problem, and BIC is used to approximate Bayes factors. The criterion proposed is based on the BIC difference between a candidate clustering model for the given subset and a model which assumes no clustering for the same subset. Thus, the problem amounts to finding the feature subset which maximises such a criterion. A search over the potentially vast solution space is performed using genetic algorithms, which are stochastic search algorithms that use techniques and concepts inspired by evolutionary biology and natural selection. Numerical experiments using real data applications are presented and discussed.},

abstract = {Crimes (e.g., assault, arson, harassment, and murder) have emerged as one of the most critical problems countries face. In particular, in Brazil, crime is a theme of growing interest and the prime concern in some cities, due to the high crime rates, the sheer magnitude of violence and the perceived number of lives lost. In this paper, we aim at predicting crimes in each region of a city before they happen and efficiently identify where target police resources that will be used to prevent the crimes from occurring. A relevant amount of approaches available in the literature address this problem by suggesting that Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) can accurately forecast crime and outperform other approaches for crime prediction. However, none of these approaches approximate the crime hotspots to the road network by considering that the police patrols move constrained by road networks. Besides, none of these approaches propose incrementally discovery of crime hotspots in a life-long manner. This work proposes PHAR (stands for Polygon Hotspots Approximated to Road network), a batch KDE algorithm-based that outputs the crime hotspots approximated to the road network and helps to allocate police patrols to forestall new crimes to come up. Another contribution is an algorithm i-PHAR that incrementally updates the previous KDE computation according to the new streams of crime occurrences reported. Indeed, this can accelerate the crime hotspots detection since there is no need to compute the KDE algorithm from scratch for new streams of data. In the experimental evaluation, conducted on a real-world dataset, we demonstrate the validity of PHAR and i-PHAR with respect to the state-of-the-art available in the literature in terms of quality of results.},

abstract = {The advantages of the digital PCR technology are already well documented until now. One way to achieve better cost efficiency of the technique is to use it in a multiplexing strategy. Droplet digital PCR platforms, which include two fluorescence filters, support at least duplex reactions and with some developments and optimization higher multiplexing is possible. The present study not only shows a development of multiplex assays in droplet digital PCR, but also presents a first thorough evaluation of several parameters in such multiplex digital PCR. Two 4-plex assays were developed for quantification of 8 different DNA targets (7 genetically modified maize events and maize endogene). Per assay, two of the targets were labelled with one fluorophore and two with another. As current analysis software does not support analysis of more than duplex, a new R- and Shiny-based web application analysis tool (http://bit.ly/ddPCRmulti) was developed that automates the analysis of 4-plex results. In conclusion, the two developed multiplex assays are suitable for quantification of GMO maize events and the same approach can be used in any other field with a need for accurate and reliable quantification of multiple DNA targets.},

abstract = {Several clustering algorithms can be applied to clustering in large multimedia databases. The effectiveness and efficiency of the existing algorithms, however, are somewhat limited, since clustering in multimedia databases requires clustering of high-dimensional feature vectors and because multimedia databases often contain large amounts of noise. In this paper, we therefore introduce a new Kernel Density Estimation-based algorithm for clustering in large multimedia databases called DENCLUE (DENsity-based CLUstEring). Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) models the overall point density analytically as the sum of kernel (or influence) functions of the data points. Clusters can then be identified by determining density attractors and clusters of arbitrary shape can be easily described by a simple equation of the overall density function. The advantages of our KDE-based DENCLUE approach are: (1) it has a firm mathematical basis; (2) it has good clustering properties in data sets with large amounts of noise; (3) it allows a compact mathematical description of arbitrarily shaped clusters in high-dimensional data sets; and (4) it is significantly faster than existing algorithms. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DENCLUE, we perform a series of experiments on a number of different data sets from CAD and molecular biology. A comparison with k-Means, DBSCAN, and BIRCH shows the superiority of our new algorithm},

abstract = {KRAS mutations are responsible for resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy in colorectal cancer patients. These mutations sometimes appear once treatment has started. Detection of KRAS mutations in circulating cell-free DNA in plasma (“liquid biopsy”) by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has emerged as a very sensitive and promising alternative to serial biopsies for disease monitoring. In this study, KRAS G12V mutation was analyzed by ddPCR in plasma DNA from 10 colorectal cancer patients and compared to six healthy donors. The percentage of KRAS G12V mutation relative to wild-type sequences in tumor-derived DNA was also determined. KRAS G12V mutation circulating in plasma was detected in 9 of 10 colorectal cancer patients whose tumors were also mutated. Colorectal cancer patients had 35.62 copies of mutated KRAS/mL plasma, whereas in healthy controls only residual copies were found (0.62 copies/mL, p = 0.0066). Interestingly, patients with metastatic disease showed a significantly higher number of mutant copies than M0 patients (126.25 versus 9.37 copies/mL, p = 0.0286). Wild-type KRAS was also significantly elevated in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy controls (7718.8 versus 481.25 copies/mL, p = 0.0002). In conclusion, KRAS G12V mutation is detectable in plasma of colorectal cancer patients by ddPCR and could be used as a non-invasive biomarker.},

abstract = {Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (CFSFDP) is a novel algorithm that efficiently discovers the centers of clusters by finding the density peaks. The accuracy of CFSFDP depends on the accurate estimation of densities for a given dataset and also on the selection of the cutoff distance (dc). Mainly, dc is used to calculate the density of each data point and to identify the border points in the clusters. CFSFDP necessitates using different methods for estimating the densities of different datasets and the estimation of dc largely depends on subjective experience. To overcome the limitations of CFSFDP, this paper presents a method for CFSFDP via heat diffusion (CFSFDP-HD). CFSFDP-HD proposes a nonparametric method for estimating the probability distribution of a given dataset. Based on heat diffusion in an infinite domain, this method accounts for both selection of the cutoff distance and boundary correction of the kernel density estimation. Experimental results on standard clustering benchmark datasets validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach over CFSFDP, AP, mean shift, and K-means methods.},

abstract = {Digital PCR is rapidly gaining interest in the field of molecular biology for absolute quantification of nucleic acids. However, the first generation of platforms still needs careful validation and requires a specificmethodology for data analysis to distinguish negative from positive signals by defining a threshold value. The currently described methods to assess droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) are based on an underlying assumption that the fluorescent signal of droplets is normally distributed. We show that this normality assumption does not likely hold true for most ddPCR runs, resulting in an erroneous threshold. We suggest a methodology that does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the fluorescence readouts. A threshold is estimated by modelling the extreme values in the negative droplet population using extreme value theory. Furthermore, the method takes shifts in baseline fluorescence between samples into account. An R implementation of our method is available, allowing automated threshold determination for absolute ddPCR quantification using a single fluorescent reporter.},

abstract = {Clustering by fast search and finding of Density Peaks (called as DPC) introduced by Alex Rodr{\'{i}}guez and Alessandro Laio attracted much attention in the field of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. However, DPC still has a lot of defects that are not resolved. Firstly, the local density pi of point i is affected by the cutoff distance dc, which can influence the clustering result, especially for small real-world cases. Secondly, the number of clusters is still found intuitively by using the decision diagram to select the cluster centers. In order to overcome these defects, this paper proposes an automatic density peaks clustering approach using DNA genetic algorithm optimized data field and Gaussian process (referred to as ADPC-DNAGA). ADPC-DNAGA can extract the optimal value of threshold with the potential entropy of data field and automatically determine the cluster centers by Gaussian method. For any data set to be clustered, the threshold can be calculated from the data set objectively rather than the empirical estimation. The proposed clustering algorithm is benchmarked on publicly available synthetic and real-world datasets which are commonly used for testing the performance of clustering algorithms. The clustering results are compared not only with that of DPC but also with that of several well-known clustering algorithms such as Affinity Propagation, DBSCAN and Spectral Cluster. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed clustering algorithm can find the optimal cutoff distance dc, to automatically identify clusters, regardless of their shape and dimension of the embedded space, and can often outperform the comparisons.},

@article{Wilson2016,
abstract = {Background: Digital PCR (dPCR) is a technique for estimating the concentration of a target nucleic acid by loading a sample into a large number of partitions, amplifying the target and using a fluorescent marker to identify which partitions contain the target. The standard analysis uses only the proportion of partitions containing target to estimate the concentration and depends on the assumption that the initial distribution of molecules in partitions is Poisson. In this paper we describe a way to extend such analysis using the quantification cycle (Cq) data that may also be available, but rather than assuming the Poisson distribution the more general Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution is used instead. Results: A software package for the open source language R has been created for performing the analysis. This was used to validate the method by analysing Cq data from dPCR experiments involving 3 types of DNA (attenuated, virulent and plasmid) at 3 concentrations. Results indicate some deviation from the Poisson distribution, which is strongest for the virulent DNA sample. Theoretical calculations indicate that the deviation from the Poisson distribution results in a bias of around 5 {\%} for the analysed data if the standard analysis is used, but that it could be larger for higher concentrations. Compared to the estimates of subsequent efficiency, the estimates of 1st cycle efficiency are much lower for the virulent DNA, moderately lower for the attenuated DNA and close for the plasmid DNA. Further method validation using simulated data gave results closer to the true values and with lower standard deviations than the standard method, for concentrations up to approximately 2.5 copies/partition. Conclusions: The Cq-based method is effective at estimating DNA concentration and is not seriously affected by data issues such as outliers and moderately non-linear trends. The data analysis suggests that the Poisson assumption of the standard approach does lead to a bias that is fairly small, though more research is needed. Estimates of the 1st cycle efficiency being lower than estimates of the subsequent efficiency may indicate samples that are mixtures of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. The model can reduce or eliminate the resulting bias.},

abstract = {Identifying differentially variable (DV) genomic probes is becoming a new approach to detect novel genomic risk factors for complex human diseases. The F test is the standard equal-variance test in statistics. For high-throughput genomic data, the probe-wise F test has been successfully used to detect biologically relevant DNA methylation marks that have different variances between two groups of subjects (e.g., cases versus controls). In addition to DNA methylation, microRNA (miRNA) is another important mechanism of epigenetics. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have identified DV miRNAs. In this article, we proposed a novel model-based clustering method to improve the power of the probe-wise F test to detect DV miRNAs. We imposed special structures on covariance matrices for each cluster of miRNAs based on the prior information about the relationship between variances in cases and controls and about the independence among them. Simulation studies showed that the proposed method seems promising in detecting DV probes. Based on two real datasets about human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we identified 7 DV-only miRNAs (hsa-miR-1826, hsa-miR-191, hsa-miR-194-star, hsa-miR-222, hsa-miR-502-3p, hsa-miR-93, and hsa-miR-99b) using the proposed method, one (hsa-miR-1826) of which has not yet been reported to be related to HCC in the literature.},

abstract = {Background: Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) is an increasingly popular technology for detecting and quantifying target nucleic acids. Its advertised strength is high precision absolute quantification without needing reference curves. The standard data analytic approach follows a seemingly straightforward theoretical framework but ignores sources of variation in the data generating process. These stem from both technical and biological factors, where we distinguish features that are 1) hard-wired in the equipment, 2) user-dependent and 3) provided by manufacturers but may be adapted by the user. The impact of the corresponding variance components on the accuracy and precision of target concentration estimators presented in the literature is studied through simulation.Results: We reveal how system-specific technical factors influence accuracy as well as precision of concentration estimates. We find that a well-chosen sample dilution level and modifiable settings such as the fluorescence cut-off for target copy detection have a substantial impact on reliability and can be adapted to the sample analysed in ways that matter. User-dependent technical variation, including pipette inaccuracy and specific sources of sample heterogeneity, leads to a steep increase in uncertainty of estimated concentrations. Users can discover this through replicate experiments and derived variance estimation. Finally, the detection performance can be improved by optimizing the fluorescence intensity cut point as suboptimal thresholds reduce the accuracy of concentration estimates considerably.Conclusions: Like any other technology, dPCR is subject to variation induced by natural perturbations, systematic settings as well as user-dependent protocols. Corresponding uncertainty may be controlled with an adapted experimental design. Our findings point to modifiable key sources of uncertainty that form an important starting point for the development of guidelines on dPCR design and data analysis with correct precision bounds. Besides clever choices of sample dilution levels, experiment-specific tuning of machine settings can greatly improve results. Well-chosen data-driven fluorescence intensity thresholds in particular result in major improvements in target presence detection. We call on manufacturers to provide sufficiently detailed output data that allows users to maximize the potential of the method in their setting and obtain high precision and accuracy for their experiments.},

abstract = {The authenticity and traceability of meat products are issues of primary importance to ensure food safety. Unfortunately, food adulteration (e.g. the addition of inexpensive cuts to minced meat products) and mislabelling (e.g. the inclusion of meat from species other than those declared) happens frequently worldwide. The aim of this study was to apply a droplet digital PCR assay for the detection and quantification (copies $\mu$L−1) of the beef, pork, horse, sheep, chicken and turkey in meat products. The analysis conducted on commercial meat showed the presence of traces of DNA from other animal species than those declared. We show that the method is highly sensitive, specific and accurate (accuracy = 100{\%}). This method could be adopted by competent food safety authorities to verify compliance with the labelling of meat products and to ensure quality and safety throughout the meat supply chain, from primary production to consumption.},

abstract = {Climate classification aims to divide a given region into distinct groups on the basis of meteorological variables, and it has important applications in fields such as agriculture and buildings. In this paper, we propose a novel spectral clustering-based method to partition 661 meteorological stations in China into several zones. First, the correlations are analyzed among five meteorological variables: daily average temperature, average relative humidity, sunshine hours, diurnal temperature range, and atmospheric pressure. The resulting weak linear correlation supports the classification under multiple views. Next, a similarity matrix/graph is constructed by combining the advantages of k-nearest-neighbor and sparse subspace representation. The blocking effect of the similarity matrix confirms the rationality of the classification. Then, we consider respectively the climate classification under a single view and multiple views. For the single view, atmospheric pressure has the highest imbalance degree, and sunshine hours and diurnal temperature range have the strongest classification consistency. The consistency rates are improved evidently in a multiple-view situation. Afterward, we propose a determining method for the number of clusters and make a sensitivity analysis on various parameters. Finally, we provide a further statistical analysis on the classification results and compare the consistency with another climate dataset. All experimental results show that the proposed classification method is feasible and effective in the climate zoning of China.},

abstract = {Background: The provision of general practitioners (GPs) in Germany still relies mainly on the ratio of inhabitants to GPs at relatively large scales and barely accounts for an increased prevalence of chronic diseases among the elderly and socially underprivileged populations. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is one of the major cost-intensive diseases with high rates of potentially preventable complications. Provision of healthcare and access to preventive measures is necessary to reduce the burden of T2DM. However, current studies on the spatial variation of T2DM in Germany are mostly based on survey data, which do not only underestimate the true prevalence of T2DM, but are also only available on large spatial scales. The aim of this study is therefore to analyse the spatial distribution of T2DM at fine geographic scales and to assess location-specific risk factors based on data of the AOK health insurance. Methods: To display the spatial heterogeneity of T2DM, a bivariate, adaptive kernel density estimation (KDE) was applied. The spatial scan statistic (SaTScan) was used to detect areas of high risk. Global and local spatial regression models were then constructed to analyze socio-demographic risk factors of T2DM. Results: T2DM is especially concentrated in rural areas surrounding Berlin. The risk factors for T2DM consist of proportions of 65-79 year olds, 80 + year olds, unemployment rate among the 55-65 year olds, proportion of employees covered by mandatory social security insurance, mean income tax, and proportion of non-married couples. However, the strength of the association between T2DM and the examined socio-demographic variables displayed strong regional variations. Conclusion: The prevalence of T2DM varies at the very local level. Analyzing point data on T2DM of northeastern Germany's largest health insurance provider thus allows very detailed, location-specific knowledge about increased medical needs. Risk factors associated with T2DM depend largely on the place of residence of the respective person. Future allocation of GPs and current prevention strategies should therefore reflect the location-specific higher healthcare demand among the elderly and socially underprivileged populations.},

abstract = {Digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (dPCR) is a novel method for the absolute quantification of target nucleic acids. Quantification by dPCR hinges on the fact that the random distribution of molecules in many partitions follows a Poisson distribution. Each partition acts as an individual PCR microreactor and partitions containing amplified target sequences are detected by fluorescence. The proportion of PCR-positive partitions suffices to determine the concentration of the target sequence without a need for calibration. Advances in microfluidics enabled the current revolution of digital quantification by providing efficient partitioning methods. In this review, we compare the fundamental concepts behind the quantification of nucleic acids by dPCR and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). We detail the underlying statistics of dPCR and explain how it defines its precision and performance metrics. We review the different microfluidic digital PCR formats, present their underlying physical principles, and analyze the technological evolution of dPCR platforms. We present the novel multiplexing strategies enabled by dPCR and examine how isothermal amplification could be an alternative to PCR in digital assays. Finally, we determine whether the theoretical advantages of dPCR over qPCR hold true by perusing studies that directly compare assays implemented with both methods.},

abstract = {Isogenus nubecula is a critically endangered Plecoptera species. Considered extinct in the UK, I. nubecula was recently rediscovered (in one location of the River Dee, Wales), after 22 years of absence. In a similar way to many other species of Perlodidae, I. nubecula could be utilised as a bio-indicator, for assessing water quality and health status of a given freshwater system. However, conventional monitoring of invertebrates via kick-sampling, is invasive and expensive (time consuming). Further, such methods require a high level of taxonomic expertise. Here, we compared the traditional kick-sampling method with the use of eDNA detection using qPCR and ddPCR-analyses. In spring 2018, we sampled eDNA from twelve locations on the River Dee. I. nubecula was detected using kick-sampling in five of these locations, three locations using both eDNA detection and kick-sampling and one location using eDNA detection alone – resulting in a total of six known and distinct populations of this critically endangered species. Interestingly, despite the eDNA assay being validated in vitro and in silico, and results indicating high sensitivity, qPCR analysis of the eDNA samples proved to be ineffective. In contrast, ddPCR analyses resulted in a clear detection of I. nubecula at four locations suggesting that inhibition most likely explains the large discrepancy between the obtained qPCR and ddPCR results. It is therefore important to explore inhibition effects on any new eDNA assay. We also highlight that ddPCR may well be the best option for the detection of aquatic organisms which are either rare or likely to shed low levels of eDNA into their environment.},

Ecological differentiation often occurs at fine genomic levels, yet it is unclear how to utilise ecological information to define ecotypes given the breadth of environmental variation among microbial taxa. Here, we present an analytical framework that infers clusters along genome-based microbial phylogenies according to shared environmental responses. The advantage of our approach is the ability to identify genomic clusters that best fit complex environmental information whilst characterising cluster niches through model predictions. We apply our method to determine climate-associated ecotypes in populations of nitrogen-fixing symbionts using whole genomes, explicitly sampled to detect climate differentiation across a heterogeneous landscape. Although soil and plant host characteristics strongly influence distribution patterns of inferred ecotypes, our flexible statistical method enabled us to identify climate-associated genomic clusters using environmental data, providing solid support for ecological specialisation in soil symbionts.},

abstract = {Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections have increased during the past decade but little is known about geographic clustering patterns. Methods: We used a unique analytical approach, combining geographic information systems (GIS), spatial epidemiology, and statistical modeling to identify and characterize HCV hotspots, statistically significant clusters of census tracts with elevated HCV counts and rates. We compiled sociodemographic and HCV surveillance data (n = 99,780 cases) for Massachusetts census tracts (n = 1464) from 2002 to 2013. We used a five-step spatial epidemiological approach, calculating incremental spatial autocorrelations and Getis-Ord Gi* statistics to identify clusters. We conducted logistic regression analyses to determine factors associated with the HCV hotspots. Results: We identified nine HCV clusters, with the largest in Boston, New Bedford/Fall River, Worcester, and Springfield (p {\textless} 0.05). In multivariable analyses, we found that HCV hotspots were independently and positively associated with the percent of the population that was Hispanic (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.07; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.04, 1.09) and the percent of households receiving food stamps (AOR: 1.83; 95{\%} CI: 1.22, 2.74). HCV hotspots were independently and negatively associated with the percent of the population that were high school graduates or higher (AOR: 0.91; 95{\%} CI: 0.89, 0.93) and the percent of the population in the "other" race/ethnicity category (AOR: 0.88; 95{\%} CI: 0.85, 0.91). Conclusion: We identified locations where HCV clusters were a concern, and where enhanced HCV prevention, treatment, and care can help combat the HCV epidemic in Massachusetts. GIS, spatial epidemiological and statistical analyses provided a rigorous approach to identify hotspot clusters of disease, which can inform public health policy and intervention targeting. Further studies that incorporate spatiotemporal cluster analyses, Bayesian spatial and geostatistical models, spatially weighted regression analyses, and assessment of associations between HCV clustering and the built environment are needed to expand upon our combined spatial epidemiological and statistical methods.},

These mixtures are more robust to variations from normality and can account for skewness, varying tail weight, and peakedness of data. A generalized expectation-maximization approach combining minorization-maximization and optimization based on accelerated line search algorithms on the Stiefel manifold is used for parameter estimation. These mixtures are implemented both in the model-based clustering and classification frameworks.

Among the existing algorithms, researches on packet classification algorithms based on hierarchical trie have become an important packet classification research branch because of their widely practical use. Although hierarchical trie is beneficial to save large storage space, it has several shortcomings such as the existence of backtracking and empty nodes. This paper proposes a new packet classification algorithm, Hierarchical Trie Algorithm Based on Expectation-Maximization Clustering (HTEMC). Firstly, this paper uses the formalization method to deal with the packet classification problem by means of mapping the rules and data packets into a two-dimensional space. Secondly, this paper uses expectation-maximization algorithm to cluster the rules based on their aggregate characteristics, and thereby diversified clusters are formed. Thirdly, this paper proposes a hierarchical trie based on the results of expectation-maximization clustering. Finally, this paper respectively conducts simulation experiments and real-environment experiments to compare the performances of our algorithm with other typical algorithms, and analyzes the results of the experiments. The hierarchical trie structure in our algorithm not only adopts trie path compression to eliminate backtracking, but also solves the problem of low efficiency of trie updates, which greatly improves the performance of the algorithm.},

However, currently reported or commercial dPCR devices are not suitable for applications in laboratories or zones with limited infrastructures, due to low function integration, cost-inefficiency, or weak mobility. Herein, in order to enable accurate DNA quantitative analysis in such situations, we have developed a smartphone-based mobile dPCR device integrated with thermal cycling control, on-chip dPCR, data acquisition, and result analysis. All the function units are automatically controlled using a customized Android software. The device is approximately 90 mm × 90 mm × 100 mm in size and about 500 g in weight, only costing about 320 dollars except the smartphone. Coupled with the self-priming dPCR chip previously developed by our lab, the device is able to accurately quantify down to 10 copies of the human 18 S ribosomal DNA fragment inserted in a plasmid. Comparing to the commercial QuantStudio™ 3D dPCR platform, our device achieves a comparable analytical accuracy. Besides, our device is capable of detecting single molecule of cancer biomarker gene CD147 in a low number of HepG2 cells. Therefore, our dPCR device as a low-cost, potable, and robust tool for highly accurate DNA quantitative analysis has a great potential in Point-of-care (POC) applications.},

abstract = {This paper presents a clustering-based strategy to identify typical daily electricity usage (TDEU) profiles of multiple buildings. Different from the majority of existing clustering strategies, the proposed strategy consists of two levels of clustering, i.e. intra-building clustering and inter-building clustering. The intra-building clustering used a Gaussian mixture model-based clustering to identify the TDEU profiles of each individual building. The inter-building clustering used an agglomerative hierarchical clustering to identify the TDEU profiles of multiple buildings based on the TDEU profiles identified for each individual building through intra-building clustering. The performance of this strategy was evaluated using two-year hourly electricity consumption data collected from 40 university buildings. The results showed that this strategy can discover useful information related to building electricity usage, including typical patterns of daily electricity usage (DEU) and periodical variation of DEU. It was also shown that this proposed strategy can identify additional electricity usage patterns with a less computational cost, in comparison to two single-step clustering strategies including a Partitioning Around Medoids-based clustering strategy and a hierarchical clustering strategy. The results obtained from this study could be potentially used to assist in improving energy performance of university buildings and other types of buildings.},

abstract = {Introduction: Detection of the JAK2 V617F mutation is a key step in the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Sensitive real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) detection on peripheral blood (PB) is the most widely used method. The main objective of this study was to determine whether serum, the most common material available in archival biobanks, is a good liquid biopsy for detecting and quantifying the JAK2 V617F mutation using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Methods: Paired PB and serum samples from 66 patients with MPN were used. Serum samples were frozen at −25°C before analysis. DNA was extracted from 200 $\mu$L PB and 400 $\mu$L serum, and ddPCR analysis was performed. Results: Among the 47 patients with detectable mutation in their PB samples, the overall sensitivity for the detection of JAK2 mutation in serum was of 96{\%} (45 of 47); V617F was detected in all cases where mutation load was above 1{\%}. Our results showed very strong correlation between PB and serum (Spearman r: 0.989, P {\textless}.0001). Significantly higher allele burden was detected in serum compared to PB (Wilcoxon signed ranks test, Z = −5.672, P {\textless}.0001). Conclusion: In our study, JAK2 V617F mutation load as low as 1{\%} was reliably detected in serum using ddPCR.},

abstract = {Since the invention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 1985, PCR has played a significant role in molecular diagnostics for genetic diseases, pathogens, oncogenes and forensic identification. In the past three decades, PCR has evolved from end-point PCR, through real-time PCR, to its current version, which is the absolute quantitive digital PCR (dPCR). In this review, we first discuss the principles of all key steps of dPCR, i.e., sample dispersion, amplification, and quantification, covering commercialized apparatuses and other devices still under lab development. We highlight the advantages and disadvantages of different technologies based on these steps, and discuss the emerging biomedical applications of dPCR. Finally, we provide a glimpse of the existing challenges and future perspectives for dPCR.},

abstract = {Motivation: Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is an emerging technology for quantifying DNA. By partitioning the target DNA into 20 000 droplets, each serving as its own PCR reaction compartment, a very high sensitivity of DNA quantification can be achieved. However, manual analysis of the data is time consuming and algorithms for automated analysis of non-orthogonal, multiplexed ddPCR data are unavailable, presenting a major bottleneck for the advancement of ddPCR transitioning from low-throughput to high-throughput. Results: ddPCRclust is an R package for automated analysis of data from Bio-Rad's droplet digital PCR systems (QX100 and QX200). It can automatically analyze and visualize multiplexed ddPCR experiments with up to four targets per reaction. Results are on par with manual analysis, but only take minutes to compute instead of hours. The accompanying Shiny app ddPCRvis provides easy access to the functionalities of ddPCRclust through a web-browser based GUI.},

abstract = {Digital PCR is rapidly gaining interest in the field of molecular biology for absolute quantification of nucleic acids. However, the first generation of platforms still needs careful validation and requires a specificmethodology for data analysis to distinguish negative from positive signals by defining a threshold value. The currently described methods to assess droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) are based on an underlying assumption that the fluorescent signal of droplets is normally distributed. We show that this normality assumption does not likely hold true for most ddPCR runs, resulting in an erroneous threshold. We suggest a methodology that does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the fluorescence readouts. A threshold is estimated by modelling the extreme values in the negative droplet population using extreme value theory. Furthermore, the method takes shifts in baseline fluorescence between samples into account. An R implementation of our method is available, allowing automated threshold determination for absolute ddPCR quantification using a single fluorescent reporter.},

While it is known that misclassification has a major impact on the concentration estimate and substantially reduces accuracy, the uncertainty of this classification is typically ignored. We introduce a model-based clustering method to estimate the probability that the target is present (absent) in a partition conditional on its observed fluorescence and the distributional shape in no-template control samples. This methodology acknowledges the inherent uncertainty of the classification and provides a natural measure of precision, both at individual partition level and at the level of the global concentration. We illustrate our method on genetically modified organism, inhibition, dynamic range, and mutation detection experiments. We show that our method provides concentration estimates of similar accuracy or better than the current standard, along with a more realistic measure of precision. The individual partition probabilities and diagnostic density plots further allow for some quality control. An R implementation of our method, called Umbrella, is available, providing a more objective and automated data analysis procedure for absolute dPCR quantification.},

abstract = {Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) represents a new and alternative platform to conventional quantitative-PCR (qPCR) for the quantitation of DNA templates. However, the proposed improvement in sensitivity and reproducibility offered by ddPCR is not yet fully proven, partly because the delineation between positive and negative responses is not always clear.Data are presented demonstrating the sensitivity of the ddPCR system to both reagent concentrations and choice of cut-off for defining positive and negative results. By implementing k-nearest clustering, cut-offs are produced that improve the accuracy of ddPCR where target DNA is present at low copy numbers, a key application of ddPCR. This approach is applied to human albumin and HIV-1 proviral DNA ddPCR quantitative protocols. This tool is coded in JavaScript and has been made available for free in a web browser at http://www.definetherain.org.uk. Optimisation of the analyses of raw ddPCR data using 'definetherain' indicates that low target number detection can be improved by its implementation.

In addition to the missing clusters used in the classical Gaussian mixture model, the proposed approach assumes that the means of the Gaussian densities are latent variables distributed according to random walks. The parameters of the proposed algorithm are estimated by the maximum likelihood approach. However, the EM algorithm cannot be applied directly due to the complex structure of the model, and some approximations are required. Using a variational approximation, an algorithm called VEM-DyMix is proposed to estimate the parameters of the proposed model. Using simulated data, the ability of the proposed approach to accurately estimate the parameters is demonstrated. VEM-DyMix outperforms, in terms of clustering and estimation accuracy, other state-of-the-art algorithms. The experiments performed on real world data from two fields of application (railway condition monitoring and object tracking from videos) show the strong potential of the proposed algorithms.},

abstract = {Risk-based treatment of onsite wastewaters for decentralized reuse requires information on the occurrence and density of pathogens in source waters, which differ from municipal wastewater due to scaling and dilution effects in addition to variable source contributions. In this first quantitative report of viral enteric pathogens in onsite-collected graywater and wastewater, untreated graywater (n = 50 samples) and combined wastewater (i.e., including blackwater; n = 28) from three decentralized collection systems were analyzed for two norovirus genogroups (GI/GII) and human adenoviruses using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Compared to traditional quantitative PCR (qPCR), which had insufficient sensitivity to quantify viruses in graywater, ddPCR allowed quantification of norovirus GII and adenovirus in 4{\%} and 14{\%} of graywater samples, respectively (none quantifiable for norovirus GI). Norovirus GII was routinely quantifiable in combined wastewater by either PCR method (96{\%} of samples), with well-correlated results between the analyses (R2 = 0.96) indicating a density range of 5.2–7.9 log10 genome copies/L. These concentrations are greater than typically reported in centralized municipal wastewater, yet agree well with an epidemiology-based model previously used to develop pathogen log-reduction targets (LRTs) for decentralized non-potable water systems. Results emphasize the unique quality of onsite wastewaters, supporting the previous LRTs and further quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) of decentralized water reuse.},

abstract = {Many of the current accredited methods for the molecular detection of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in foods rely on a PCR-based screen for the pathotype-specific genetic markers stx and eae. Unfortunately, these methods can inaccurately conclude the presence of E. coli containing both stx and eae because of the inability of the methods to determine if the two genes originated from a single organism as opposed to a mixture of organisms. This study was undertaken to evaluate if a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)-based method that does not require DNA isolation could reliably identify the presence of an STEC containing eae in beef samples by confirming that both genes reside within the same cell, even when present in a mixed culture. The ddPCR system used in this study, dd-Check STEC Solution (Bio-Rad), works without the need for DNA isolation by partitioning intact cells into emulsion droplets, where they are lysed, and subsequently undergo multiplexed endpoint PCR. This enables the assay to differentiate between samples where a single organism contains both stx and eae from samples in which stx and eae reside in different organisms. Comparisons were made between the dd-Check STEC Solution, the BAX System Real-Time PCR STEC assay suite (Hygiena), and the iQ-Check STEC PCR detection kit (Bio-Rad) using 37 unique simulations of E. coli contamination in ground beef. While no single platform was consistently superior at detecting eae and stx across all pathogens tested, the results indicated that the dd-Check STEC Solution has the potential to reduce the number of inaccurately identified samples when screening for E. coli with a stx+, eae+ genotype because it can identify the co-existence of multiple virulence genes within a cell even when in the presence of a mixed microbial population containing identical genes. Ultimately, incorporation of this system could result in substantial cost savings by reducing the expenses incurred when product samples are incorrectly classified as containing E. coli with a stx+, eae+ genotype.},

abstract = {The sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in seagrass meadows as organic carbon (OC) has been attracting more attention as a means for climate change mitigation and adaptation. A direct method to detect seagrass DNA in coastal sediments, which is essential to unravel long-term seagrass-derived OC accumulation, was developed based on environmental DNA (eDNA) detection techniques. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) were applied to quantify Zostera marina DNA in coastal sediments, using species-specific primers and dual-labeled probes for one nuclear and one chloroplast gene. Suitable pretreatments and methods for extracting Z. marina DNA from coastal sediments were examined and their applicability to environmental samples was demonstrated. Surface sediments collected from Z. marina meadows contained about 2000 times more Z. marina DNA than the unvegetated tidal-flats in the Seto Inland Sea. Moreover, both qPCR and ddPCR successfully detected Z. marina DNA in ancient sediments (up to 5000 calibrated years before present), evidencing that Z. marina DNA can be preserved in temperate coastal sediments for several millennia. In addition, qPCR and ddPCR results obtained in the present study were highly correlated, although the latter was more accurate than qPCR, particularly at low eDNA concentrations in ancient sediments. This work opens avenues to explore and clarify the process of the sequestration of OC produced by Z. marina and demonstrate the presence of past seagrass meadows from several millennia.},
