abstract = {Isogenus nubecula is a critically endangered Plecoptera species. Considered extinct in the UK, I. nubecula was recently rediscovered (in one location of the River Dee, Wales), after 22 years of absence. In a similar way to many other species of Perlodidae, I. nubecula could be utilised as a bio-indicator, for assessing water quality and health status of a given freshwater system. However, conventional monitoring of invertebrates via kick-sampling, is invasive and expensive (time consuming). Further, such methods require a high level of taxonomic expertise. Here, we compared the traditional kick-sampling method with the use of eDNA detection using qPCR and ddPCR-analyses. In spring 2018, we sampled eDNA from twelve locations on the River Dee. I. nubecula was detected using kick-sampling in five of these locations, three locations using both eDNA detection and kick-sampling and one location using eDNA detection alone – resulting in a total of six known and distinct populations of this critically endangered species. Interestingly, despite the eDNA assay being validated in vitro and in silico, and results indicating high sensitivity, qPCR analysis of the eDNA samples proved to be ineffective. In contrast, ddPCR analyses resulted in a clear detection of I. nubecula at four locations suggesting that inhibition most likely explains the large discrepancy between the obtained qPCR and ddPCR results. It is therefore important to explore inhibition effects on any new eDNA assay. We also highlight that ddPCR may well be the best option for the detection of aquatic organisms which are either rare or likely to shed low levels of eDNA into their environment.},

abstract = {The advantages of the digital PCR technology are already well documented until now. One way to achieve better cost efficiency of the technique is to use it in a multiplexing strategy. Droplet digital PCR platforms, which include two fluorescence filters, support at least duplex reactions and with some developments and optimization higher multiplexing is possible. The present study not only shows a development of multiplex assays in droplet digital PCR, but also presents a first thorough evaluation of several parameters in such multiplex digital PCR. Two 4-plex assays were developed for quantification of 8 different DNA targets (7 genetically modified maize events and maize endogene). Per assay, two of the targets were labelled with one fluorophore and two with another. As current analysis software does not support analysis of more than duplex, a new R- and Shiny-based web application analysis tool (http://bit.ly/ddPCRmulti) was developed that automates the analysis of 4-plex results. In conclusion, the two developed multiplex assays are suitable for quantification of GMO maize events and the same approach can be used in any other field with a need for accurate and reliable quantification of multiple DNA targets.},

abstract = {Risk-based treatment of onsite wastewaters for decentralized reuse requires information on the occurrence and density of pathogens in source waters, which differ from municipal wastewater due to scaling and dilution effects in addition to variable source contributions. In this first quantitative report of viral enteric pathogens in onsite-collected graywater and wastewater, untreated graywater (n = 50 samples) and combined wastewater (i.e., including blackwater; n = 28) from three decentralized collection systems were analyzed for two norovirus genogroups (GI/GII) and human adenoviruses using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Compared to traditional quantitative PCR (qPCR), which had insufficient sensitivity to quantify viruses in graywater, ddPCR allowed quantification of norovirus GII and adenovirus in 4{\%} and 14{\%} of graywater samples, respectively (none quantifiable for norovirus GI). Norovirus GII was routinely quantifiable in combined wastewater by either PCR method (96{\%} of samples), with well-correlated results between the analyses (R2 = 0.96) indicating a density range of 5.2–7.9 log10 genome copies/L. These concentrations are greater than typically reported in centralized municipal wastewater, yet agree well with an epidemiology-based model previously used to develop pathogen log-reduction targets (LRTs) for decentralized non-potable water systems. Results emphasize the unique quality of onsite wastewaters, supporting the previous LRTs and further quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) of decentralized water reuse.},

abstract = {The sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in seagrass meadows as organic carbon (OC) has been attracting more attention as a means for climate change mitigation and adaptation. A direct method to detect seagrass DNA in coastal sediments, which is essential to unravel long-term seagrass-derived OC accumulation, was developed based on environmental DNA (eDNA) detection techniques. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) were applied to quantify Zostera marina DNA in coastal sediments, using species-specific primers and dual-labeled probes for one nuclear and one chloroplast gene. Suitable pretreatments and methods for extracting Z. marina DNA from coastal sediments were examined and their applicability to environmental samples was demonstrated. Surface sediments collected from Z. marina meadows contained about 2000 times more Z. marina DNA than the unvegetated tidal-flats in the Seto Inland Sea. Moreover, both qPCR and ddPCR successfully detected Z. marina DNA in ancient sediments (up to 5000 calibrated years before present), evidencing that Z. marina DNA can be preserved in temperate coastal sediments for several millennia. In addition, qPCR and ddPCR results obtained in the present study were highly correlated, although the latter was more accurate than qPCR, particularly at low eDNA concentrations in ancient sediments. This work opens avenues to explore and clarify the process of the sequestration of OC produced by Z. marina and demonstrate the presence of past seagrass meadows from several millennia.},

abstract = {Many of the current accredited methods for the molecular detection of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in foods rely on a PCR-based screen for the pathotype-specific genetic markers stx and eae. Unfortunately, these methods can inaccurately conclude the presence of E. coli containing both stx and eae because of the inability of the methods to determine if the two genes originated from a single organism as opposed to a mixture of organisms. This study was undertaken to evaluate if a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)-based method that does not require DNA isolation could reliably identify the presence of an STEC containing eae in beef samples by confirming that both genes reside within the same cell, even when present in a mixed culture. The ddPCR system used in this study, dd-Check STEC Solution (Bio-Rad), works without the need for DNA isolation by partitioning intact cells into emulsion droplets, where they are lysed, and subsequently undergo multiplexed endpoint PCR. This enables the assay to differentiate between samples where a single organism contains both stx and eae from samples in which stx and eae reside in different organisms. Comparisons were made between the dd-Check STEC Solution, the BAX System Real-Time PCR STEC assay suite (Hygiena), and the iQ-Check STEC PCR detection kit (Bio-Rad) using 37 unique simulations of E. coli contamination in ground beef. While no single platform was consistently superior at detecting eae and stx across all pathogens tested, the results indicated that the dd-Check STEC Solution has the potential to reduce the number of inaccurately identified samples when screening for E. coli with a stx+, eae+ genotype because it can identify the co-existence of multiple virulence genes within a cell even when in the presence of a mixed microbial population containing identical genes. Ultimately, incorporation of this system could result in substantial cost savings by reducing the expenses incurred when product samples are incorrectly classified as containing E. coli with a stx+, eae+ genotype.},

The aim of this study was to apply a droplet digital PCR assay for the detection and quantification (copies $\mu$L−1) of the beef, pork, horse, sheep, chicken and turkey in meat products. The analysis conducted on commercial meat showed the presence of traces of DNA from other animal species than those declared.

This method could be adopted by competent food safety authorities to verify compliance with the labelling of meat products and to ensure quality and safety throughout the meat supply chain, from primary production to consumption.},

abstract = {Introduction: Detection of the JAK2 V617F mutation is a key step in the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Sensitive real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) detection on peripheral blood (PB) is the most widely used method. The main objective of this study was to determine whether serum, the most common material available in archival biobanks, is a good liquid biopsy for detecting and quantifying the JAK2 V617F mutation using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Methods: Paired PB and serum samples from 66 patients with MPN were used. Serum samples were frozen at −25°C before analysis. DNA was extracted from 200 $\mu$L PB and 400 $\mu$L serum, and ddPCR analysis was performed. Results: Among the 47 patients with detectable mutation in their PB samples, the overall sensitivity for the detection of JAK2 mutation in serum was of 96{\%} (45 of 47); V617F was detected in all cases where mutation load was above 1{\%}. Our results showed very strong correlation between PB and serum (Spearman r: 0.989, P {\textless}.0001). Significantly higher allele burden was detected in serum compared to PB (Wilcoxon signed ranks test, Z = −5.672, P {\textless}.0001). Conclusion: In our study, JAK2 V617F mutation load as low as 1{\%} was reliably detected in serum using ddPCR.},

Here, we verified the discrepancy in the circRNA quantification by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and reverse transcription-droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (RT-ddPCR), which is caused by the rolling reverse transcription (RT) product originating from the circular structure. In addition, we detected the stability of cell-free circRNA in serum/plasma and determined the pre-analysis sampling procedure that will compromise the quantification of circRNA. Our results showed that prolonged RT incubation time resulted in multiple PCR products from circular RNA, which will reduce the accuracy of circRNA quantification by RT-qPCR technology, whereas ddPCR can address this limitation and could be a good alternative to qPCR for circRNA quantification.

abstract = {KRAS mutations are responsible for resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy in colorectal cancer patients. These mutations sometimes appear once treatment has started. Detection of KRAS mutations in circulating cell-free DNA in plasma (“liquid biopsy”) by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has emerged as a very sensitive and promising alternative to serial biopsies for disease monitoring. In this study, KRAS G12V mutation was analyzed by ddPCR in plasma DNA from 10 colorectal cancer patients and compared to six healthy donors. The percentage of KRAS G12V mutation relative to wild-type sequences in tumor-derived DNA was also determined. KRAS G12V mutation circulating in plasma was detected in 9 of 10 colorectal cancer patients whose tumors were also mutated. Colorectal cancer patients had 35.62 copies of mutated KRAS/mL plasma, whereas in healthy controls only residual copies were found (0.62 copies/mL, p = 0.0066). Interestingly, patients with metastatic disease showed a significantly higher number of mutant copies than M0 patients (126.25 versus 9.37 copies/mL, p = 0.0286). Wild-type KRAS was also significantly elevated in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy controls (7718.8 versus 481.25 copies/mL, p = 0.0002). In conclusion, KRAS G12V mutation is detectable in plasma of colorectal cancer patients by ddPCR and could be used as a non-invasive biomarker.},

abstract = {Digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (dPCR) is a novel method for the absolute quantification of target nucleic acids. Quantification by dPCR hinges on the fact that the random distribution of molecules in many partitions follows a Poisson distribution. Each partition acts as an individual PCR microreactor and partitions containing amplified target sequences are detected by fluorescence. The proportion of PCR-positive partitions suffices to determine the concentration of the target sequence without a need for calibration. Advances in microfluidics enabled the current revolution of digital quantification by providing efficient partitioning methods. In this review, we compare the fundamental concepts behind the quantification of nucleic acids by dPCR and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). We detail the underlying statistics of dPCR and explain how it defines its precision and performance metrics. We review the different microfluidic digital PCR formats, present their underlying physical principles, and analyze the technological evolution of dPCR platforms. We present the novel multiplexing strategies enabled by dPCR and examine how isothermal amplification could be an alternative to PCR in digital assays. Finally, we determine whether the theoretical advantages of dPCR over qPCR hold true by perusing studies that directly compare assays implemented with both methods.},

However, the proposed improvement in sensitivity and reproducibility offered by ddPCR is not yet fully proven, partly because the delineation between positive and negative responses is not always clear.Data are presented demonstrating the sensitivity of the ddPCR system to both reagent concentrations and choice of cut-off for defining positive and negative results. By implementing k-nearest clustering, cut-offs are produced that improve the accuracy of ddPCR where target DNA is present at low copy numbers, a key application of ddPCR. This approach is applied to human albumin and HIV-1 proviral DNA ddPCR quantitative protocols. This tool is coded in JavaScript and has been made available for free in a web browser at http://www.definetherain.org.uk. Optimisation of the analyses of raw ddPCR data using 'definetherain' indicates that low target number detection can be improved by its implementation.

While it is known that misclassification has a major impact on the concentration estimate and substantially reduces accuracy, the uncertainty of this classification is typically ignored. We introduce a model-based clustering method to estimate the probability that the target is present (absent) in a partition conditional on its observed fluorescence and the distributional shape in no-template control samples. This methodology acknowledges the inherent uncertainty of the classification and provides a natural measure of precision, both at individual partition level and at the level of the global concentration. We illustrate our method on genetically modified organism, inhibition, dynamic range, and mutation detection experiments. We show that our method provides concentration estimates of similar accuracy or better than the current standard, along with a more realistic measure of precision. The individual partition probabilities and diagnostic density plots further allow for some quality control. An R implementation of our method, called Umbrella, is available, providing a more objective and automated data analysis procedure for absolute dPCR quantification.},

abstract = {Limiting dilution PCR has become an increasingly useful technique for the detection and quantification of rare species in a population, but the limit of detection and accuracy of quantification are largely determined by the number of reactions that can be analyzed. Increased throughput may be achieved by reducing the reaction volume and increasing processivity. We have designed a high-throughput microfluidic chip that encapsulates PCR reagents in millions of picoliter droplets in a continuous oil flow. The oil stream conducts the droplets through alternating denaturation and annealing zones, resulting in rapid (55-s cycles) and efficient PCR amplification. Inclusion of fluorescent probes in the PCR reaction mix permits the amplification process to be monitored within individual droplets at specific locations within the microfluidic chip. We show that amplification of a 245-bp adenovirus product can be detected and quantified in 35 min at starting template concentrations as low as 1 template molecule/167 droplets (0.003 pg/$\mu$L). The frequencies of positive reactions over a range of template concentrations agree closely with the frequencies predicted by Poisson statistics, demonstrating both the accuracy and sensitivity of this platform for limiting dilution and digital PCR applications. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) provides the most sensitive measurement of residual infection in patients on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has recently been shown to provide highly accurate quantification of DNA copy number, but its application to quantification of HIV DNA, or other equally rare targets, has not been reported. This paper demonstrates and analyzes the application of ddPCR to measure the frequency of total HIV DNA (pol copies per million cells), and episomal 2-LTR (long terminal repeat) circles in cells isolated from infected patients. Analysis of over 300 clinical samples, including over 150 clinical samples assayed in triplicate by ddPCR and by real-time PCR (qPCR), demonstrates a significant increase in precision, with an average 5-fold decrease in the coefficient of variation of pol copy numbers and a {\textgreater}20-fold accuracy improvement for 2-LTR circles. Additional benefits of the ddPCR assay over qPCR include absolute quantification without reliance on an external standard and relative insensitivity to mismatches in primer and probe sequences. These features make digital PCR an attractive alternative for measurement of HIV DNA in clinical specimens. The improved sensitivity and precision of measurement of these rare events should facilitate measurements to characterize the latent HIV reservoir and interventions to eradicate it.},

abstract = {Digital PCR (dPCR) is a highly accurate molecular approach, capable of precise measurements, offering a number of unique opportunities. However, in its current format dPCR can be limited by the amount of sample that can be analysed and consequently additional considerations such as performing multiplex reactions or pre-amplification can be considered. This study investigated the impact of duplexing and pre-amplification on dPCR analysis by using three different assays targeting a model template (a portion of the Arabidopsis thaliana alcohol dehydrogenase gene). We also investigated the impact of different template types (linearised plasmid clone and more complex genomic DNA) on measurement precision using dPCR. We were able to demonstrate that duplex dPCR can provide a more precise measurement than uniplex dPCR, while applying pre-amplification or varying template type can significantly decrease the precision of dPCR. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the pre-amplification step can introduce measurement bias that is not consistent between experiments for a sample or assay and so could not be compensated for during the analysis of this data set. We also describe a model for estimating the prevalence of molecular dropout and identify this as a source of dPCR imprecision. Our data have demonstrated that the precision afforded by dPCR at low sample concentration can exceed that of the same template post pre-amplification thereby negating the need for this additional step. Our findings also highlight the technical differences between different templates types containing the same sequence that must be considered if plasmid DNA is to be used to assess or control for more complex templates like genomic DNA. {\textcopyright} 2013 Whale et al.},

@article{Garriga2016,
abstract = {The growing capacity to process and store animal tracks has spurred the development of new methods to segment animal trajectories into elementary units of movement. Key challenges for movement trajectory segmentation are to (i) minimize the need of supervision, (ii) reduce computational costs, (iii) minimize the need of prior assumptions (e.g. simple parametrizations), and (iv) capture biologically meaningful semantics, useful across a broad range of species. We introduce the Expectation-Maximization binary Clustering (EMbC), a general purpose, unsupervised approach to multivariate data clustering. The EMbC is a variant of the Expectation-Maximization Clustering (EMC), a clustering algorithm based on the maximum likelihood estimation of a Gaussian mixture model. This is an iterative algorithm with a closed form step solution and hence a reasonable computational cost. The method looks for a good compromise between statistical soundness and ease and generality of use (by minimizing prior assumptions and favouring the semantic interpretation of the final clustering). Here we focus on the suitability of the EMbC algorithm for behavioural annotation of movement data. We show and discuss the EMbC outputs in both simulated trajectories and empirical movement trajectories including different species and different tracking methodologies. We use synthetic trajectories to assess the performance of EMbC compared to classic EMC and Hidden Markov Models. Empirical trajectories allow us to explore the robustness of the EMbC to data loss and data inaccuracies, and assess the relationship between EMbC output and expert label assignments. Additionally, we suggest a smoothing procedure to account for temporal correlations among labels, and a proper visualization of the output for movement trajectories. Our algorithm is available as an R-package with a set of complementary functions to ease the analysis.},

abstract = {Background: Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) is an increasingly popular technology for detecting and quantifying target nucleic acids. Its advertised strength is high precision absolute quantification without needing reference curves. The standard data analytic approach follows a seemingly straightforward theoretical framework but ignores sources of variation in the data generating process. These stem from both technical and biological factors, where we distinguish features that are 1) hard-wired in the equipment, 2) user-dependent and 3) provided by manufacturers but may be adapted by the user. The impact of the corresponding variance components on the accuracy and precision of target concentration estimators presented in the literature is studied through simulation.Results: We reveal how system-specific technical factors influence accuracy as well as precision of concentration estimates. We find that a well-chosen sample dilution level and modifiable settings such as the fluorescence cut-off for target copy detection have a substantial impact on reliability and can be adapted to the sample analysed in ways that matter. User-dependent technical variation, including pipette inaccuracy and specific sources of sample heterogeneity, leads to a steep increase in uncertainty of estimated concentrations. Users can discover this through replicate experiments and derived variance estimation. Finally, the detection performance can be improved by optimizing the fluorescence intensity cut point as suboptimal thresholds reduce the accuracy of concentration estimates considerably.Conclusions: Like any other technology, dPCR is subject to variation induced by natural perturbations, systematic settings as well as user-dependent protocols. Corresponding uncertainty may be controlled with an adapted experimental design. Our findings point to modifiable key sources of uncertainty that form an important starting point for the development of guidelines on dPCR design and data analysis with correct precision bounds. Besides clever choices of sample dilution levels, experiment-specific tuning of machine settings can greatly improve results. Well-chosen data-driven fluorescence intensity thresholds in particular result in major improvements in target presence detection. We call on manufacturers to provide sufficiently detailed output data that allows users to maximize the potential of the method in their setting and obtain high precision and accuracy for their experiments.},

An open-source R script was written for the ddPCR data analysis. Analysis of a set of samples with known health status aided the assessment and selection of different threshold settings (QuantaSoft analysis, definetherain pipeline and manual threshold), which led to optimal diagnostic specificity. The interpretation of the E. amylovora ddPCR was straightforward, and the analysis approach had little influence on the final results and the concentrations determined. The sensitivity and linear range were similar to those for real-time PCR (qPCR), for the analysis of both bacterial suspensions and plant material, making ddPCR a viable choice when both detection and quantification are desired. With the R. solanacearum ddPCR, the use of a high global threshold was necessary to exclude false-positive reactions that are sometimes observed in healthy plant material. ddPCR significantly improved the analytical sensitivity over that of qPCR, and improved the detection of low concentrations of R. solanacearum in potato tuber samples. Accurate and rapid absolute quantification of both of these bacteria in pure culture was achieved by direct ddPCR. Our data confirm the suitability of these ddPCR assays for routine detection and quantification of plant pathogens and for preparation of defined in-house reference materials with known target concentrations.},

However, the first generation of platforms still needs careful validation and requires a specificmethodology for data analysis to distinguish negative from positive signals by defining a threshold value. The currently described methods to assess droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) are based on an underlying assumption that the fluorescent signal of droplets is normally distributed. We show that this normality assumption does not likely hold true for most ddPCR runs, resulting in an erroneous threshold. We suggest a methodology that does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the fluorescence readouts. A threshold is estimated by modelling the extreme values in the negative droplet population using extreme value theory. Furthermore, the method takes shifts in baseline fluorescence between samples into account. An R implementation of our method is available, allowing automated threshold determination for absolute ddPCR quantification using a single fluorescent reporter.},

abstract = {Background: Digital PCR (dPCR) is a technique for estimating the concentration of a target nucleic acid by loading a sample into a large number of partitions, amplifying the target and using a fluorescent marker to identify which partitions contain the target. The standard analysis uses only the proportion of partitions containing target to estimate the concentration and depends on the assumption that the initial distribution of molecules in partitions is Poisson. In this paper we describe a way to extend such analysis using the quantification cycle (Cq) data that may also be available, but rather than assuming the Poisson distribution the more general Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution is used instead. Results: A software package for the open source language R has been created for performing the analysis. This was used to validate the method by analysing Cq data from dPCR experiments involving 3 types of DNA (attenuated, virulent and plasmid) at 3 concentrations. Results indicate some deviation from the Poisson distribution, which is strongest for the virulent DNA sample. Theoretical calculations indicate that the deviation from the Poisson distribution results in a bias of around 5 {\%} for the analysed data if the standard analysis is used, but that it could be larger for higher concentrations. Compared to the estimates of subsequent efficiency, the estimates of 1st cycle efficiency are much lower for the virulent DNA, moderately lower for the attenuated DNA and close for the plasmid DNA. Further method validation using simulated data gave results closer to the true values and with lower standard deviations than the standard method, for concentrations up to approximately 2.5 copies/partition. Conclusions: The Cq-based method is effective at estimating DNA concentration and is not seriously affected by data issues such as outliers and moderately non-linear trends. The data analysis suggests that the Poisson assumption of the standard approach does lead to a bias that is fairly small, though more research is needed. Estimates of the 1st cycle efficiency being lower than estimates of the subsequent efficiency may indicate samples that are mixtures of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. The model can reduce or eliminate the resulting bias.},

abstract = {Digital PCR is rapidly being adopted in the field of DNA-based food analysis. The direct, absolute quantification it offers makes it an attractive technology for routine analysis of food and feed samples for their composition, possible GMO content, and compliance with labelling requirements. However, assessing the performance of dPCR assays is not yet well established. This article introduces three straightforward parameters based on statistical principles that allow users to evaluate if their assays are robust. In addition, we present post-run evaluation criteria to check if quantification was accurate. Finally, we evaluate the usefulness of Poisson confidence intervals and present an alternative strategy to better capture the variability in the analytical chain.},

abstract = {Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) circumventing the external calibration and potentially providing absolute quantification of nucleic acids has become an increasingly popular manifestation of PCR in biological researches. However, currently reported or commercial dPCR devices are not suitable for applications in laboratories or zones with limited infrastructures, due to low function integration, cost-inefficiency, or weak mobility. Herein, in order to enable accurate DNA quantitative analysis in such situations, we have developed a smartphone-based mobile dPCR device integrated with thermal cycling control, on-chip dPCR, data acquisition, and result analysis. All the function units are automatically controlled using a customized Android software. The device is approximately 90 mm × 90 mm × 100 mm in size and about 500 g in weight, only costing about 320 dollars except the smartphone. Coupled with the self-priming dPCR chip previously developed by our lab, the device is able to accurately quantify down to 10 copies of the human 18 S ribosomal DNA fragment inserted in a plasmid. Comparing to the commercial QuantStudio™ 3D dPCR platform, our device achieves a comparable analytical accuracy. Besides, our device is capable of detecting single molecule of cancer biomarker gene CD147 in a low number of HepG2 cells. Therefore, our dPCR device as a low-cost, potable, and robust tool for highly accurate DNA quantitative analysis has a great potential in Point-of-care (POC) applications.},
