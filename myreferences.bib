abstract = {The problem of temporal data clustering is addressed using a dynamic Gaussian mixture model. In addition to the missing clusters used in the classical Gaussian mixture model, the proposed approach assumes that the means of the Gaussian densities are latent variables distributed according to random walks. The parameters of the proposed algorithm are estimated by the maximum likelihood approach. However, the EM algorithm cannot be applied directly due to the complex structure of the model, and some approximations are required. Using a variational approximation, an algorithm called VEM-DyMix is proposed to estimate the parameters of the proposed model. Using simulated data, the ability of the proposed approach to accurately estimate the parameters is demonstrated. VEM-DyMix outperforms, in terms of clustering and estimation accuracy, other state-of-the-art algorithms. The experiments performed on real world data from two fields of application (railway condition monitoring and object tracking from videos) show the strong potential of the proposed algorithms.},

abstract = {With the development of computer network bandwidth, packet classification algorithms which are able to deal with large-scale rule sets are in urgent need. Among the existing algorithms, researches on packet classification algorithms based on hierarchical trie have become an important packet classification research branch because of their widely practical use. Although hierarchical trie is beneficial to save large storage space, it has several shortcomings such as the existence of backtracking and empty nodes. This paper proposes a new packet classification algorithm, Hierarchical Trie Algorithm Based on Expectation-Maximization Clustering (HTEMC). Firstly, this paper uses the formalization method to deal with the packet classification problem by means of mapping the rules and data packets into a two-dimensional space. Secondly, this paper uses expectation-maximization algorithm to cluster the rules based on their aggregate characteristics, and thereby diversified clusters are formed. Thirdly, this paper proposes a hierarchical trie based on the results of expectation-maximization clustering. Finally, this paper respectively conducts simulation experiments and real-environment experiments to compare the performances of our algorithm with other typical algorithms, and analyzes the results of the experiments. The hierarchical trie structure in our algorithm not only adopts trie path compression to eliminate backtracking, but also solves the problem of low efficiency of trie updates, which greatly improves the performance of the algorithm.},

abstract = {The performance of thermal cyclers for polymerase chain reactions (PCR) is of great concern in terms of the reliability of PCR-based assays, particularly when rapid cycling conditions are applied to small volume reactions. In this work, the precision of the temperature controls during rapid thermal cycling was measured in 19 commercial thermal cyclers of 8 different models. The temperatures of test solutions in specific locations in each thermal block were simultaneously monitored at 1 s intervals during thermal cycling. A temperature-sensitive multiplex PCR was run in parallel to assess undesirable PCR results caused by poor temperature control. Under the given conditions (20 s of annealing time and 20 $\mu$L reaction volume), a majority of the tested instruments showed prominent curving, undershooting, and/or overshooting in their temperature profiles, which substantially influenced the results of the temperature-sensitive multiplex PCR. Variations between wells were also observed in most instruments. It is strongly hoped that these problems will be addressed by manufacturers and that they will make substantial improvements in the precision and efficiency of thermal cyclers. In the meantime, users of thermal cyclers might be able to avoid unexpected poor outcomes of sensitive PCR-based assays by designing their PCR protocols with these findings in mind.},

Important variables that can influence the outcome of PCR include the MgCl(2) concentration and the cycling temperatures. Additives that promote polymerase stability and processivity or increase hybridization stringency, and strategies that reduce nonspecific primer-template interactions, especially prior to the critical first cycle, can greatly improve sensitivity, specificity, and yield. This protocol is designed to optimize the reaction components and conditions in one or two stages. The first stage determines the optimal MgCl(2) concentration and screens several enhancing additives. To further improve specificity, sensitivity and yield, the second stage compares methods for optimizing initial specific hybridization to prevent polymerization of misprimed sequences prior to thermal cycling. For initial inhibition of polymerase activity, temperature (i.e., cooling reagents), physical separation ("hot start" method), and reversible antibody binding are compared.},

abstract = {Accurate and precise nucleic-acid quantification is crucial for clinical and diagnostic decisions, as overestimation or underestimation can lead to misguided treatment of a disease or incorrect labelling of the products. Digital PCR is one of the best tools for absolute nucleic-acid copy-number determination. However, digital PCR needs to be well characterised in terms of accuracy and sources of uncertainty. With droplet digital PCR, discrepancies between the droplet volume assigned by the manufacturer and measured by independent laboratories have already been shown in previous studies. In the present study, we report on the results of an inter-laboratory comparison of different methods for droplet volume determination that is based on optical microscopy imaging and is traceable to the International System of Units. This comparison was conducted on the same DNA material, with the examination of the influence of parameters such as droplet generators, supermixes, operators, inter-cartridge and intra-cartridge variability, and droplet measuring protocol. The mean droplet volume was measured using a QX200™ AutoDG™ Droplet Digital™ PCR system and two QX100™ Droplet Digital™ PCR systems. The data show significant volume differences between these two systems, as well as significant differences in volume when different supermixes are used. We also show that both of these droplet generator systems produce droplets with significantly lower droplet volumes (13.1{\%}, 15.9{\%}, respectively) than stated by the manufacturer and previously measured by other laboratories. This indicates that to ensure precise quantification, the droplet volumes should be assessed for each system.},

One of the critical factors in the measurement of copy number concentrations by digital PCR is the partition volume. Therefore, we determined the average droplet volume by optical microscopy, revealing an average droplet volume that is 8 {\%} smaller than the droplet volume used as the defined parameter in the QuantaSoft software version 1.3.2.0 (Bio-Rad) to calculate the copy number concentration. This observation explains why copy number concentrations estimated with ddPCR and using an average droplet volume predefined in the QuantaSoft software were systematically lower than those measured by dPCR, creating a significant bias between the values obtained by these two techniques. The difference was not significant anymore when the measured droplet volume of 0.834 nL was used to estimate copy number concentrations. A new version of QuantaSoft software (version 1.6.6.0320), which has since been released with Bio-Rad's new QX200 systems and QX100 upgrades, uses a droplet volume of 0.85 nL as a defined parameter to calculate copy number concentration.},

This novel ddPCR format offers a simple workflow capable of generating highly stable partitioning of DNA molecules. In this study, we assessed key performance parameters of the ddPCR system. A linear ddPCR response to DNA concentration was obtained from 0.16{\%} through to 99.6{\%} saturation in a 20,000 droplet assay corresponding to more than 4 orders of magnitude of target DNA copy number per ddPCR. Analysis of simplex and duplex assays targeting two distinct loci in the Lambda DNA genome using the ddPCR platform agreed, within their expanded uncertainties, with values obtained using a lower density microfluidic chamber based digital PCR (cdPCR). A relative expanded uncertainty under 5{\%} was achieved for copy number concentration using ddPCR. This level of uncertainty is much lower than values typically observed for quantification of specific DNA target sequences using currently commercially available real-time and digital cdPCR technologies. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Digital PCR in droplets (ddPCR) is an emerging method for more and more applications in DNA (and RNA) analysis. Special requirements when establishing ddPCR for analysis of genetically modified organisms (GMO) in a laboratory include the choice between validated official qPCR methods and the optimization of these assays for a ddPCR format. Differentiation between droplets with positive reaction and negative droplets, that is setting of an appropriate threshold, can be crucial for a correct measurement. This holds true in particular when independent transgene and plant-specific reference gene copy numbers have to be combined to determine the content of GM material in a sample. Droplets which show fluorescent units ranging between those of explicit positive and negative droplets are called 'rain'. Signals of such droplets can hinder analysis and the correct setting of a threshold. In this manuscript, a computer-based algorithm has been carefully designed to evaluate assay performance and facilitate objective criteria for assay optimization. Optimized assays in return minimize the impact of rain on ddPCR analysis.We developed an Excel based 'experience matrix' that reflects the assay parameters of GMO ddPCR tests performed in our laboratory. Parameters considered include singleplex/duplex ddPCR, assay volume, thermal cycler, probe manufacturer, oligonucleotide concentration, annealing/elongation temperature, and a droplet separation evaluation. We additionally propose an objective droplet separation value which is based on both absolute fluorescence signal distance of positive and negative droplet populations and the variation within these droplet populations. The proposed performance classification in the experience matrix can be used for a rating of different assays for the same GMO target, thus enabling employment of the best suited assay parameters. Main optimization parameters include annealing/extension temperature and oligonucleotide concentrations.The droplet separation value allows for easy and reproducible assay performance evaluation. The combination of separation value with the experience matrix simplifies the choice of adequate assay parameters for a given GMO event.},

Because of regulation of cultivation and trade of GMOs in several countries, there is pressure for their accurate detection and quantification. Today, DNA-based approaches are more popular for this purpose than protein-based methods, and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is still the gold standard in GMO analytics. However, digital PCR (dPCR) offers several advantages over qPCR, making this new technique appealing also for GMO analysis. This critical review focuses on the use of dPCR for the purpose of GMO quantification and addresses parameters which are important for achieving accurate and reliable results, such as the quality and purity of DNA and reaction optimization. Three critical factors are explored and discussed in more depth: correct classification of partitions as positive, correctly determined partition volume, and dilution factor. This review could serve as a guide for all laboratories implementing dPCR. Most of the parameters discussed are applicable to fields other than purely GMO testing.

However, the comparability of different dPCR platforms with respect to measurement of DNA copy number must be addressed before dPCR can be classified fundamentally as an absolute quantification technique. The comparability of four dPCR platforms with respect to accuracy and measurement uncertainty was investigated by using a certified plasmid reference material. Plasmid conformation was found to have a significant effect on droplet-based dPCR (QX100 and RainDrop) not shared with chip-based QuantStudio 12k or BioMark. The relative uncertainty of partition volume was determined to be 0.7{\%}, 0.8{\%}, 2.3{\%} and 2.9{\%} for BioMark, QX100, QuantStudio 12k and RainDrop, respectively. The measurements of the certified pNIM-001 plasmid made using the four dPCR platforms were corrected for partition volume and closely consistent with the certified value within the expended uncertainty. This demonstrated that the four dPCR platforms are of comparable effectiveness in quantifying DNA copy number. These findings provide an independent assessment of this method of determining DNA copy number when using different dPCR platforms and underline important factors that should be taken into consideration in the design of dPCR experiments.},

abstract = {Oysters are frequently associated with norovirus outbreaks, but the presence of norovirus RNA in oysters does not necessarily imply a health risk to humans. There is a close link between human illness and consumption of oysters with high levels of norovirus RNA, but oysters with low levels of norovirus RNA are more unlikely to be associated with illness. Reliable and precise quantification methods are therefore important for outbreak investigations and risk assessments. This study optimised and validated RT droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) assays for quantification of norovirus genogroups I and II in artificially contaminated oysters, and compared them with the standard method, RT real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). The two methods had comparable 95{\%} limits of detection, but RT-ddPCR generally showed greater precision in quantification. Differences between fluorometric measurements and quantification with RT-ddPCR were determined on in vitro transcribed RNA with targets for norovirus genogroups I and II. Quantification by RT-ddPCR was on average 100 times lower than the fluorometric value for norovirus GI and 15.8 times lower than the fluorometric value for norovirus GII. The large inter-assay difference observed highlights the need for monitoring the RT efficiency in RT-ddPCR, especially when results from different assays are compared. Overall, this study suggests that RT-ddPCR can be a suitable method for precise quantification of norovirus genogroups I and II in oysters.},

abstract = {Quantitative PCR (qPCR) has become the gold standard technique to measure cDNA and gDNA levels but the resulting data can be highly variable, artifactual and non-reproducible without appropriate verification and validation of both samples and primers. The root cause of poor quality data is typically associated with inadequate dilution of residual protein and chemical contaminants that variably inhibit Taq polymerase and primer annealing. The most susceptible, frustrating and often most interesting samples are those containing low abundant targets with small expression differences of 2-fold or lower. Here, Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) and qPCR platforms were directly compared for gene expression analysis using low amounts of purified, synthetic DNA in well characterized samples under identical reaction conditions. We conclude that for sample/target combinations with low levels of nucleic acids (Cq ≥ 29) and/or variable amounts of chemical and protein contaminants, ddPCR technology will produce more precise, reproducible and statistically significant results required for publication quality data. A stepwise methodology is also described to choose between these complimentary technologies to obtain the best results for any experiment.},

abstract = {Background Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is associated with Merkel cell carcinoma and high viral load in the skin was proposed as a risk factor for the occurrence of this tumour. MCPyV DNA was detected, with lower frequency, in different skin cancers but since the viral load was usually low, the real prevalence of viral DNA could be underestimated. Objective To evaluate the performance of two assays (qPCR and ddPCR) for MCPyV detection and quantification in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. Methods Both assays were designed to simultaneous detection and quantification of both MCPyV as well as house-keeping DNA in clinical samples. The performance of MCPyV quantification was investigated using serial dilutions of cloned target DNA. We also evaluated the applicability of both tests for the analysis of 76 FFPE cutaneous biopsies. Results The two approaches resulted equivalent with regard to the reproducibility and repeatability and showed a high degree of linearity in the dynamic range tested in the present study. Moreover, qPCR was able to quantify ≥105 copies per reaction, while the upper limit of ddPCR was 104 copies. There was not significant difference between viral load measured by the two methods The detection limit of both tests was 0,15 copies per reaction, however, the number of positive samples obtained by ddPCR was higher than that obtained by qPCR (45{\%} and 37{\%} respectively). Conclusions The ddPCR represents a better method for detection of MCPyV in FFPE biopsies, mostly these containing low copies number of viral genome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is the technique most often used to quantify pathogen presence. Digital PCR (dPCR) is a new technique with the potential to have a substantial impact on plant pathology research owing to its reproducibility, sensitivity and low susceptibility to inhibitors. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using dPCR and qPCR to quantify Phytophthora nicotianae in several background matrices, including host tissues (stems and roots) and soil samples. RESULTS: In spite of the low dynamic range of dPCR (3 logs compared with 7 logs for qPCR), this technique proved to have very high precision applicable at very low copy numbers. The dPCR was able to detect accurately the pathogen in all type of samples in a broad concentration range. Moreover, dPCR seems to be less susceptible to inhibitors than qPCR in plant samples. Linear regression analysis showed a high correlation between the results obtained with the two techniques in soil, stem and root samples, with R2 = 0.873, 0.999 and 0.995 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that dPCR is a promising alternative for quantifying soil-borne pathogens in environmental samples, even in early stages of the disease.},

abstract = {Background: Next-generation DNA sequencing on the 454, Solexa, and SOLiD platforms requires absolute calibration of the number of molecules to be sequenced. This requirement has two unfavorable consequences. First, large amounts of sample-typically micrograms-are needed for library preparation, thereby limiting the scope of samples which can be sequenced. For many applications, including metagenomics and the sequencing of ancient, forensic, and clinical samples, the quantity of input DNA can be critically limiting. Second, each library requires a titration sequencing run, thereby increasing the cost and lowering the throughput of sequencing. Results: We demonstrate the use of digital PCR to accurately quantify 454 and Solexa sequencing libraries, enabling the preparation of sequencing libraries from nanogram quantities of input material while eliminating costly and time-consuming titration runs of the sequencer. We successfully sequenced low-nanogram scale bacterial and mammalian DNA samples on the 454 FLX and Solexa DNA sequencing platforms. This study is the first to definitively demonstrate the successful sequencing of picogram quantities of input DNA on the 454 platform, reducing the sample requirement more than 1000-fold without pre-amplification and the associated bias and reduction in library depth. Conclusion: The digital PCR assay allows absolute quantification of sequencing libraries, eliminates uncertainties associated with the construction and application of standard curves to PCR-based quantification, and with a coefficient of variation close to 10{\%}, is sufficiently precise to enable direct sequencing without titration runs. {\textcopyright} 2009 White et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Gene expression measurements detailing mRNA quantities are widely employed in molecular biology and are increasingly important in diagnostic fields. Reverse transcription (RT), necessary for generating complementary DNA, can be both inefficient and imprecise, but remains a quintessential RNA analysis tool using qPCR. This study developed a Transcriptomic Calibration Material and assessed the RT reaction using digital (d)PCR for RNA measurement. While many studies characterise dPCR capabilities for DNA quantification, less work has been performed investigating similar parameters using RT-dPCR for RNA analysis. RT-dPCR measurement using three, one-step RT-qPCR kits was evaluated using single and multiplex formats when measuring endogenous and synthetic RNAs. The best performing kit was compared to UV quantification and sensitivity and technical reproducibility investigated. Our results demonstrate assay and kit dependent RT-dPCR measurements differed significantly compared to UV quantification. Different values were reported by different kits for each target, despite evaluation of identical samples using the same instrument. RT-dPCR did not display the strong inter-assay agreement previously described when analysing DNA. This study demonstrates that, as with DNA measurement, RT-dPCR is capable of accurate quantification of low copy RNA targets, but the results are both kit and target dependent supporting the need for calibration controls. {\textcopyright} 2013 Sanders et al.},

abstract = {Background: Digital PCR (dPCR) is an increasingly popular manifestation of PCR that offers a number of unique advantages when applied to preclinical research, particularly when used to detect rare mutations and in the precise quantification of nucleic acids. As is common with many new research methods, the application of dPCR to potential clinical scenarios is also being increasingly described. Content: This review addresses some of the factors that need to be considered in the application of dPCR. Compared to real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), dPCR clearly has the potential to offer more sensitive and considerably more reproducible clinical methods that could lend themselves to diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tests. But for this to be realized the technology will need to be further developed to reduce cost and simplify application. Concomitantly the preclinical research will need be reported with a comprehensive understanding of the associated errors. dPCR benefits from a far more predictable variance than qPCR but is as susceptible to upstream errors associated with factors like sampling and extraction. dPCR can also suffer systematic bias, particularly leading to underestimation, and internal positive controls are likely to be as important for dPCR as they are for qPCR, especially when reporting the absence of a sequence. Summary: In this review we highlight some of the considerations that may be needed when applying dPCR and discuss sources of error. The factors discussed here aim to assist in the translation of dPCR to diagnostic, predictive, or prognostic applications.},

Digital PCR works by partitioning a sample of DNA or cDNA into many individual, parallel PCR reactions. Current quantification methods rely on the assumption that the PCR reactions are always able to detect single target molecules. When the assumption does not hold, the copy numbers will be severely underestimated. We developed a novel dPCR quantification method which determines whether the single copy assumption is violated or not by simultaneously estimating the assay sensitivity and the copy numbers using serial dilution data sets.

abstract = {The great promise of digital PCR is the potential for unparalleled precision enabling accurate measurements for genetic quantification. A challenge associated with digital PCR experiments, when testing unknown samples, is to perform experiments at dilutions allowing the detection of one or more targets of interest at a desired level of precision. While theory states that optimal precision (Po) is achieved by targeting ∼1.59 mean copies per partition ($\lambda$), and that dynamic range (R) includes the space spanning one positive ($\lambda$L) to one negative ($\lambda$U) result from the total number of partitions (n), these results are tempered for the practitioner seeking to construct digital PCR experiments in the laboratory. A mathematical framework is presented elucidating the relationships between precision, dynamic range, number of partitions, interrogated volume, and sensitivity in digital PCR. The impact that false reaction calls and volumetric variation have on sensitivity and precision is next considered. The resultant effects on sensitivity and precision are established via Monte Carlo simulations reflecting the real-world likelihood of encountering such scenarios in the laboratory. The simulations provide insight to the practitioner on how to adapt experimental loading concentrations to counteract any one of these conditions. The framework is augmented with a method of extending the dynamic range of digital PCR, with and without increasing n, via the use of dilutions. An example experiment demonstrating the capabilities of the framework is presented enabling detection across 3.33 logs of starting copy concentration.},

@article{Sykes1992,
abstract = {We describe a general method to quantitate the total number of initial targets present in a sample using limiting dilution, PCR and Poisson statistics. The DNA target for the PCR was the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene derived from a leukemic clone that was quantitated against a background of excess rearranged IgH genes from normal lymphocytes. The PCR was optimized to provide an all-or-none end point at very low DNA target numbers. PCR amplification of the N-ras gene was used as an internal control to quantitate the number of potentially amplifiable genomes present in a sample and hence to measure the extent of DNA degradation. A two-stage PCR was necessary owing to competition between leukemic and non-leukemic templates. Study of eight leukemic samples showed that approximately two potentially amplifiable leukemic IgH targets could be detected in the presence of 160,000 competing non-leukemic genomes. The method presented quantitates the total number of initial DNA targets present in a sample, unlike most other quantitation methods that quantitate PCR products. It has wide application, because it is technically simple, does not require radioactivity, addresses the problem of excess competing targets and estimates the extent of DNA degradation in a sample.},

abstract = {The Integrated Completed Likelihood (ICL) criterion was introduced by Biernacki, Celeux and Govaert (2000) in the model-based clustering framework to select a relevant number of classes and has been used by statisticians in various application areas. A theoretical study of ICL is proposed. A contrast related to the clustering objective is introduced: the conditional classification likelihood. An estimator and model selection criteria are deduced. The properties of these new procedures are studied and ICL is proved to be an approximation of one of these criteria. We contrast these results with the current leading point of view about ICL, that it would not be consistent. Moreover these results give insights into the class notion underlying ICL and feed a reflection on the class notion in clustering. General results on penalized minimum contrast criteria and upper-bounds of the bracketing entropy in parametric situations are derived, which can be useful per se. Practical solutions for the computation of the introduced procedures are proposed, notably an adapted EM algorithm and a new initialization method for EM-like algorithms which helps to improve the estimation in Gaussian mixture models.},

An approach is proposed in the model-based clustering context to select a model and a number of clusters which both fit the data well and take advantage of the potential illustrative ability of the external variables. This approach makes use of the integrated joint likelihood of the data and the partitions at hand, namely the model-based partition and the partitions associated to the external variables. It is noteworthy that each mixture model is fitted by the maximum likelihood methodology to the data, excluding the external variables which are used to select a relevant mixture model only.

By partitioning the target DNA into 20 000 droplets, each serving as its own PCR reaction compartment, a very high sensitivity of DNA quantification can be achieved. However, manual analysis of the data is time consuming and algorithms for automated analysis of non-orthogonal, multiplexed ddPCR data are unavailable, presenting a major bottleneck for the advancement of ddPCR transitioning from low-throughput to high-throughput. Results: ddPCRclust is an R package for automated analysis of data from Bio-Rad's droplet digital PCR systems (QX100 and QX200). It can automatically analyze and visualize multiplexed ddPCR experiments with up to four targets per reaction. Results are on par with manual analysis, but only take minutes to compute instead of hours.

abstract = {Learning networks are commonly categorized in terms of supervised and unsuper- vised networks. In unsupervised learning, the training set consists of input training patterns only. In contrast, in supervised learning networks, the training data consist of many pairs of input/output patterns. Therefore, the learning process can benefit greatly from the teacher's assistance. In fact, the amount of adjustment of the up- dating coefficients often depends on the difference between the desired teacher value and the actual response. As demonstrated in Chapter 5, many supervised learning models have been found to be promising for biometric authentication; their imple- mentation often hinges on an effective data-clustering scheme, which is perhaps the most critical component in unsupervised learning methods. This chapter addresses a data-clustering algorithm, called the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, when complete or partial information of observed data is made available.},

In addition to the missing clusters used in the classical Gaussian mixture model, the proposed approach assumes that the means of the Gaussian densities are latent variables distributed according to random walks. The parameters of the proposed algorithm are estimated by the maximum likelihood approach. However, the EM algorithm cannot be applied directly due to the complex structure of the model, and some approximations are required. Using a variational approximation, an algorithm called VEM-DyMix is proposed to estimate the parameters of the proposed model. Using simulated data, the ability of the proposed approach to accurately estimate the parameters is demonstrated. VEM-DyMix outperforms, in terms of clustering and estimation accuracy, other state-of-the-art algorithms. The experiments performed on real world data from two fields of application (railway condition monitoring and object tracking from videos) show the strong potential of the proposed algorithms.},

Among the existing algorithms, researches on packet classification algorithms based on hierarchical trie have become an important packet classification research branch because of their widely practical use. Although hierarchical trie is beneficial to save large storage space, it has several shortcomings such as the existence of backtracking and empty nodes. This paper proposes a new packet classification algorithm, Hierarchical Trie Algorithm Based on Expectation-Maximization Clustering (HTEMC). Firstly, this paper uses the formalization method to deal with the packet classification problem by means of mapping the rules and data packets into a two-dimensional space. Secondly, this paper uses expectation-maximization algorithm to cluster the rules based on their aggregate characteristics, and thereby diversified clusters are formed. Thirdly, this paper proposes a hierarchical trie based on the results of expectation-maximization clustering. Finally, this paper respectively conducts simulation experiments and real-environment experiments to compare the performances of our algorithm with other typical algorithms, and analyzes the results of the experiments. The hierarchical trie structure in our algorithm not only adopts trie path compression to eliminate backtracking, but also solves the problem of low efficiency of trie updates, which greatly improves the performance of the algorithm.},

abstract = {Model-based clustering assumes that the data observed can be represented by a finite mixture model, where each cluster is represented by a parametric distribution. The Gaussian distribution is often employed in the multivariate continuous case. The identification of the subset of relevant clustering variables enables a parsimonious number of unknown parameters to be achieved, thus yielding a more efficient estimate, a clearer interpretation and often improved clustering partitions. This paper discusses variable or feature selection for model- based clustering. Following the approach of Raftery and Dean (J Am Stat Assoc 101(473):168–178, 2006), the problem of subset selection is recast as a model comparison problem, and BIC is used to approximate Bayes factors. The criterion proposed is based on the BIC difference between a candidate clustering model for the given subset and a model which assumes no clustering for the same subset. Thus, the problem amounts to finding the feature subset which maximises such a criterion. A search over the potentially vast solution space is performed using genetic algorithms, which are stochastic search algorithms that use techniques and concepts inspired by evolutionary biology and natural selection. Numerical experiments using real data applications are presented and discussed.},

Ecological differentiation often occurs at fine genomic levels, yet it is unclear how to utilise ecological information to define ecotypes given the breadth of environmental variation among microbial taxa. Here, we present an analytical framework that infers clusters along genome-based microbial phylogenies according to shared environmental responses. The advantage of our approach is the ability to identify genomic clusters that best fit complex environmental information whilst characterising cluster niches through model predictions. We apply our method to determine climate-associated ecotypes in populations of nitrogen-fixing symbionts using whole genomes, explicitly sampled to detect climate differentiation across a heterogeneous landscape. Although soil and plant host characteristics strongly influence distribution patterns of inferred ecotypes, our flexible statistical method enabled us to identify climate-associated genomic clusters using environmental data, providing solid support for ecological specialisation in soil symbionts.},

abstract = {Identifying differentially variable (DV) genomic probes is becoming a new approach to detect novel genomic risk factors for complex human diseases. The F test is the standard equal-variance test in statistics. For high-throughput genomic data, the probe-wise F test has been successfully used to detect biologically relevant DNA methylation marks that have different variances between two groups of subjects (e.g., cases versus controls). In addition to DNA methylation, microRNA (miRNA) is another important mechanism of epigenetics. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have identified DV miRNAs. In this article, we proposed a novel model-based clustering method to improve the power of the probe-wise F test to detect DV miRNAs. We imposed special structures on covariance matrices for each cluster of miRNAs based on the prior information about the relationship between variances in cases and controls and about the independence among them. Simulation studies showed that the proposed method seems promising in detecting DV probes. Based on two real datasets about human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we identified 7 DV-only miRNAs (hsa-miR-1826, hsa-miR-191, hsa-miR-194-star, hsa-miR-222, hsa-miR-502-3p, hsa-miR-93, and hsa-miR-99b) using the proposed method, one (hsa-miR-1826) of which has not yet been reported to be related to HCC in the literature.},

Different from the majority of existing clustering strategies, the proposed strategy consists of two levels of clustering, i.e. intra-building clustering and inter-building clustering. The intra-building clustering used a Gaussian mixture model-based clustering to identify the TDEU profiles of each individual building. The inter-building clustering used an agglomerative hierarchical clustering to identify the TDEU profiles of multiple buildings based on the TDEU profiles identified for each individual building through intra-building clustering. The performance of this strategy was evaluated using two-year hourly electricity consumption data collected from 40 university buildings. The results showed that this strategy can discover useful information related to building electricity usage, including typical patterns of daily electricity usage (DEU) and periodical variation of DEU. It was also shown that this proposed strategy can identify additional electricity usage patterns with a less computational cost, in comparison to two single-step clustering strategies including a Partitioning Around Medoids-based clustering strategy and a hierarchical clustering strategy. The results obtained from this study could be potentially used to assist in improving energy performance of university buildings and other types of buildings.},

abstract = {Several clustering algorithms can be applied to clustering in large multimedia databases. The effectiveness and efficiency of the existing algorithms, however, are somewhat limited, since clustering in multimedia databases requires clustering of high-dimensional feature vectors and because multimedia databases often contain large amounts of noise. In this paper, we therefore introduce a new Kernel Density Estimation-based algorithm for clustering in large multimedia databases called DENCLUE (DENsity-based CLUstEring). Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) models the overall point density analytically as the sum of kernel (or influence) functions of the data points. Clusters can then be identified by determining density attractors and clusters of arbitrary shape can be easily described by a simple equation of the overall density function. The advantages of our KDE-based DENCLUE approach are: (1) it has a firm mathematical basis; (2) it has good clustering properties in data sets with large amounts of noise; (3) it allows a compact mathematical description of arbitrarily shaped clusters in high-dimensional data sets; and (4) it is significantly faster than existing algorithms. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DENCLUE, we perform a series of experiments on a number of different data sets from CAD and molecular biology. A comparison with k-Means, DBSCAN, and BIRCH shows the superiority of our new algorithm},

In this paper, we propose a novel spectral clustering–based method to partition 661 meteorological stations in China into several zones. First, the correlations are analyzed among five meteorological variables: daily average temperature, average relative humidity, sunshine hours, diurnal temperature range, and atmospheric pressure. The resulting weak linear correlation supports the classification under multiple views. Next, a similarity matrix/graph is constructed by combining the advantages of k-nearest-neighbor and sparse subspace representation. The blocking effect of the similarity matrix confirms the rationality of the classification. Then, we consider respectively the climate classification under a single view and multiple views. For the single view, atmospheric pressure has the highest imbalance degree, and sunshine hours and diurnal temperature range have the strongest classification consistency. The consistency rates are improved evidently in a multiple-view situation. Afterward, we propose a determining method for the number of clusters and make a sensitivity analysis on various parameters. Finally, we provide a further statistical analysis on the classification results and compare the consistency with another climate dataset. All experimental results show that the proposed classification method is feasible and effective in the climate zoning of China.},

abstract = {In the field of Artificial Intelligence Machine learning provides the automatic systems which learn and improve itself from experience without being explicitly programmed. In this research work a movie recommender system is built using the K-Means Clustering and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms. The movielens dataset is taken from kaggle. The system is implemented in python programming language. The proposed work deals with the introduction of various concepts related to machine learning and recommendation system. In this work, various tools and techniques have been used to build recommender systems. Various algorithms such as K-Means Clustering, KNN, Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering have been described in detail. Further, after studying different types of machine learning algorithms, there is a clear picture of where to apply which algorithm in different areas of industries such as recommender systems, e-commerce, etc. Then there is an illustration of how implementations and working of the proposed system are used for the implementation of the movie recommender system. Various building blocks of the proposed system such as Architecture, Process Flow, Pseudo Code, Implementation and Working of the System is described in detail. Finally, in this work for different cluster values, different values of Root Mean Squared Error are obtained. In this proposed work as the no of clusters decreases, the value of RMSE also decreases. The best value of RMSE obtained is 1.081648. The results given by the proposed system are better than the existing technique on the basis of RMSE value.},

Its applications range from astronomy to bioinformatics, bibliometrics, and pattern recognition.We propose an approach based on the idea that cluster centers are characterized by a higher density than their neighbors and by a relatively large distance from points with higher densities. This idea forms the basis of a clustering procedure in which the number of clusters arises intuitively, outliers are automatically spotted and excluded fromthe analysis, and clusters are recognized regardless of their shape and of the dimensionality of the space inwhich they are embedded.We demonstrate the power of the algorithm on several test cases.},

abstract = {Clustering by fast search and finding of Density Peaks (called as DPC) introduced by Alex Rodr{\'{i}}guez and Alessandro Laio attracted much attention in the field of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. However, DPC still has a lot of defects that are not resolved. Firstly, the local density [Formula: see text] of point [Formula: see text] is affected by the cutoff distance [Formula: see text], which can influence the clustering result, especially for small real-world cases. Secondly, the number of clusters is still found intuitively by using the decision diagram to select the cluster centers. In order to overcome these defects, this paper proposes an automatic density peaks clustering approach using DNA genetic algorithm optimized data field and Gaussian process (referred to as ADPC-DNAGA). ADPC-DNAGA can extract the optimal value of threshold with the potential entropy of data field and automatically determine the cluster centers by Gaussian method. For any data set to be clustered, the threshold can be calculated from the data set objectively rather than the empirical estimation. The proposed clustering algorithm is benchmarked on publicly available synthetic and real-world datasets which are commonly used for testing the performance of clustering algorithms. The clustering results are compared not only with that of DPC but also with that of several well-known clustering algorithms such as Affinity Propagation, DBSCAN and Spectral Cluster. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed clustering algorithm can find the optimal cutoff distance [Formula: see text], to automatically identify clusters, regardless of their shape and dimension of the embedded space, and can often outperform the comparisons.},

@article{Mehmood2016,
abstract = {Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (CFSFDP) is a novel algorithm that efficiently discovers the centers of clusters by finding the density peaks. The accuracy of CFSFDP depends on the accurate estimation of densities for a given dataset and also on the selection of the cutoff distance (dc). Mainly, dc is used to calculate the density of each data point and to identify the border points in the clusters. CFSFDP necessitates using different methods for estimating the densities of different datasets and the estimation of dc largely depends on subjective experience. To overcome the limitations of CFSFDP, this paper presents a method for CFSFDP via heat diffusion (CFSFDP-HD). CFSFDP-HD proposes a nonparametric method for estimating the probability distribution of a given dataset. Based on heat diffusion in an infinite domain, this method accounts for both selection of the cutoff distance and boundary correction of the kernel density estimation. Experimental results on standard clustering benchmark datasets validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach over CFSFDP, AP, mean shift, and K-means methods.},

Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the OPDP within a context where also numerical attributes are taken into account, which represents a relevant case left open in the literature.

@article{Kauhl2016,
abstract = {Background: The provision of general practitioners (GPs) in Germany still relies mainly on the ratio of inhabitants to GPs at relatively large scales and barely accounts for an increased prevalence of chronic diseases among the elderly and socially underprivileged populations. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is one of the major cost-intensive diseases with high rates of potentially preventable complications. Provision of healthcare and access to preventive measures is necessary to reduce the burden of T2DM. However, current studies on the spatial variation of T2DM in Germany are mostly based on survey data, which do not only underestimate the true prevalence of T2DM, but are also only available on large spatial scales. The aim of this study is therefore to analyse the spatial distribution of T2DM at fine geographic scales and to assess location-specific risk factors based on data of the AOK health insurance. Methods: To display the spatial heterogeneity of T2DM, a bivariate, adaptive kernel density estimation (KDE) was applied. The spatial scan statistic (SaTScan) was used to detect areas of high risk. Global and local spatial regression models were then constructed to analyze socio-demographic risk factors of T2DM. Results: T2DM is especially concentrated in rural areas surrounding Berlin. The risk factors for T2DM consist of proportions of 65-79 year olds, 80 + year olds, unemployment rate among the 55-65 year olds, proportion of employees covered by mandatory social security insurance, mean income tax, and proportion of non-married couples. However, the strength of the association between T2DM and the examined socio-demographic variables displayed strong regional variations. Conclusion: The prevalence of T2DM varies at the very local level. Analyzing point data on T2DM of northeastern Germany's largest health insurance provider thus allows very detailed, location-specific knowledge about increased medical needs. Risk factors associated with T2DM depend largely on the place of residence of the respective person. Future allocation of GPs and current prevention strategies should therefore reflect the location-specific higher healthcare demand among the elderly and socially underprivileged populations.},

abstract = {Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections have increased during the past decade but little is known about geographic clustering patterns. Methods: We used a unique analytical approach, combining geographic information systems (GIS), spatial epidemiology, and statistical modeling to identify and characterize HCV hotspots, statistically significant clusters of census tracts with elevated HCV counts and rates. We compiled sociodemographic and HCV surveillance data (n = 99,780 cases) for Massachusetts census tracts (n = 1464) from 2002 to 2013. We used a five-step spatial epidemiological approach, calculating incremental spatial autocorrelations and Getis-Ord Gi* statistics to identify clusters. We conducted logistic regression analyses to determine factors associated with the HCV hotspots. Results: We identified nine HCV clusters, with the largest in Boston, New Bedford/Fall River, Worcester, and Springfield (p {\textless} 0.05). In multivariable analyses, we found that HCV hotspots were independently and positively associated with the percent of the population that was Hispanic (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.07; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.04, 1.09) and the percent of households receiving food stamps (AOR: 1.83; 95{\%} CI: 1.22, 2.74). HCV hotspots were independently and negatively associated with the percent of the population that were high school graduates or higher (AOR: 0.91; 95{\%} CI: 0.89, 0.93) and the percent of the population in the "other" race/ethnicity category (AOR: 0.88; 95{\%} CI: 0.85, 0.91). Conclusion: We identified locations where HCV clusters were a concern, and where enhanced HCV prevention, treatment, and care can help combat the HCV epidemic in Massachusetts. GIS, spatial epidemiological and statistical analyses provided a rigorous approach to identify hotspot clusters of disease, which can inform public health policy and intervention targeting. Further studies that incorporate spatiotemporal cluster analyses, Bayesian spatial and geostatistical models, spatially weighted regression analyses, and assessment of associations between HCV clustering and the built environment are needed to expand upon our combined spatial epidemiological and statistical methods.},

abstract = {Crimes (e.g., assault, arson, harassment, and murder) have emerged as one of the most critical problems countries face. In particular, in Brazil, crime is a theme of growing interest and the prime concern in some cities, due to the high crime rates, the sheer magnitude of violence and the perceived number of lives lost. In this paper, we aim at predicting crimes in each region of a city before they happen and efficiently identify where target police resources that will be used to prevent the crimes from occurring. A relevant amount of approaches available in the literature address this problem by suggesting that Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) can accurately forecast crime and outperform other approaches for crime prediction. However, none of these approaches approximate the crime hotspots to the road network by considering that the police patrols move constrained by road networks. Besides, none of these approaches propose incrementally discovery of crime hotspots in a life-long manner. This work proposes PHAR (stands for Polygon Hotspots Approximated to Road network), a batch KDE algorithm-based that outputs the crime hotspots approximated to the road network and helps to allocate police patrols to forestall new crimes to come up. Another contribution is an algorithm i-PHAR that incrementally updates the previous KDE computation according to the new streams of crime occurrences reported. Indeed, this can accelerate the crime hotspots detection since there is no need to compute the KDE algorithm from scratch for new streams of data. In the experimental evaluation, conducted on a real-world dataset, we demonstrate the validity of PHAR and i-PHAR with respect to the state-of-the-art available in the literature in terms of quality of results.},

abstract = {The sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in seagrass meadows as organic carbon (OC) has been attracting more attention as a means for climate change mitigation and adaptation. A direct method to detect seagrass DNA in coastal sediments, which is essential to unravel long-term seagrass-derived OC accumulation, was developed based on environmental DNA (eDNA) detection techniques. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) were applied to quantify Zostera marina DNA in coastal sediments, using species-specific primers and dual-labeled probes for one nuclear and one chloroplast gene. Suitable pretreatments and methods for extracting Z. marina DNA from coastal sediments were examined and their applicability to environmental samples was demonstrated. Surface sediments collected from Z. marina meadows contained about 2000 times more Z. marina DNA than the unvegetated tidal-flats in the Seto Inland Sea. Moreover, both qPCR and ddPCR successfully detected Z. marina DNA in ancient sediments (up to 5000 calibrated years before present), evidencing that Z. marina DNA can be preserved in temperate coastal sediments for several millennia. In addition, qPCR and ddPCR results obtained in the present study were highly correlated, although the latter was more accurate than qPCR, particularly at low eDNA concentrations in ancient sediments. This work opens avenues to explore and clarify the process of the sequestration of OC produced by Z. marina and demonstrate the presence of past seagrass meadows from several millennia.},

abstract = {KRAS mutations are responsible for resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy in colorectal cancer patients. These mutations sometimes appear once treatment has started. Detection of KRAS mutations in circulating cell-free DNA in plasma (“liquid biopsy”) by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has emerged as a very sensitive and promising alternative to serial biopsies for disease monitoring. In this study, KRAS G12V mutation was analyzed by ddPCR in plasma DNA from 10 colorectal cancer patients and compared to six healthy donors. The percentage of KRAS G12V mutation relative to wild-type sequences in tumor-derived DNA was also determined. KRAS G12V mutation circulating in plasma was detected in 9 of 10 colorectal cancer patients whose tumors were also mutated. Colorectal cancer patients had 35.62 copies of mutated KRAS/mL plasma, whereas in healthy controls only residual copies were found (0.62 copies/mL, p = 0.0066). Interestingly, patients with metastatic disease showed a significantly higher number of mutant copies than M0 patients (126.25 versus 9.37 copies/mL, p = 0.0286). Wild-type KRAS was also significantly elevated in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy controls (7718.8 versus 481.25 copies/mL, p = 0.0002). In conclusion, KRAS G12V mutation is detectable in plasma of colorectal cancer patients by ddPCR and could be used as a non-invasive biomarker.},

abstract = {Diagnostics based on circulating circular RNA (circRNA) is an emerging field for noninvasive molecular diagnosis, owing to the stable circular structure of circRNA. However, the uniquely circular structure still poses a challenge for circRNA quantification in the research community. Here, we verified the discrepancy in the circRNA quantification by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and reverse transcription-droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (RT-ddPCR), which is caused by the rolling reverse transcription (RT) product originating from the circular structure. In addition, we detected the stability of cell-free circRNA in serum/plasma and determined the pre-analysis sampling procedure that will compromise the quantification of circRNA. Our results showed that prolonged RT incubation time resulted in multiple PCR products from circular RNA, which will reduce the accuracy of circRNA quantification by RT-qPCR technology, whereas ddPCR can address this limitation and could be a good alternative to qPCR for circRNA quantification. CircRNA showed a high stability in promptly separated serum/plasma but not in delay-separated samples.},

Unfortunately, food adulteration (e.g. the addition of inexpensive cuts to minced meat products) and mislabelling (e.g. the inclusion of meat from species other than those declared) happens frequently worldwide. The aim of this study was to apply a droplet digital PCR assay for the detection and quantification (copies $\mu$L−1) of the beef, pork, horse, sheep, chicken and turkey in meat products. The analysis conducted on commercial meat showed the presence of traces of DNA from other animal species than those declared.

This method could be adopted by competent food safety authorities to verify compliance with the labelling of meat products and to ensure quality and safety throughout the meat supply chain, from primary production to consumption.},

abstract = {Many of the current accredited methods for the molecular detection of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in foods rely on a PCR-based screen for the pathotype-specific genetic markers stx and eae. Unfortunately, these methods can inaccurately conclude the presence of E. coli containing both stx and eae because of the inability of the methods to determine if the two genes originated from a single organism as opposed to a mixture of organisms. This study was undertaken to evaluate if a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)-based method that does not require DNA isolation could reliably identify the presence of an STEC containing eae in beef samples by confirming that both genes reside within the same cell, even when present in a mixed culture. The ddPCR system used in this study, dd-Check STEC Solution (Bio-Rad), works without the need for DNA isolation by partitioning intact cells into emulsion droplets, where they are lysed, and subsequently undergo multiplexed endpoint PCR. This enables the assay to differentiate between samples where a single organism contains both stx and eae from samples in which stx and eae reside in different organisms. Comparisons were made between the dd-Check STEC Solution, the BAX System Real-Time PCR STEC assay suite (Hygiena), and the iQ-Check STEC PCR detection kit (Bio-Rad) using 37 unique simulations of E. coli contamination in ground beef. While no single platform was consistently superior at detecting eae and stx across all pathogens tested, the results indicated that the dd-Check STEC Solution has the potential to reduce the number of inaccurately identified samples when screening for E. coli with a stx+, eae+ genotype because it can identify the co-existence of multiple virulence genes within a cell even when in the presence of a mixed microbial population containing identical genes. Ultimately, incorporation of this system could result in substantial cost savings by reducing the expenses incurred when product samples are incorrectly classified as containing E. coli with a stx+, eae+ genotype.},

abstract = {The advantages of the digital PCR technology are already well documented until now. One way to achieve better cost efficiency of the technique is to use it in a multiplexing strategy. Droplet digital PCR platforms, which include two fluorescence filters, support at least duplex reactions and with some developments and optimization higher multiplexing is possible. The present study not only shows a development of multiplex assays in droplet digital PCR, but also presents a first thorough evaluation of several parameters in such multiplex digital PCR. Two 4-plex assays were developed for quantification of 8 different DNA targets (7 genetically modified maize events and maize endogene). Per assay, two of the targets were labelled with one fluorophore and two with another. As current analysis software does not support analysis of more than duplex, a new R- and Shiny-based web application analysis tool (http://bit.ly/ddPCRmulti) was developed that automates the analysis of 4-plex results. In conclusion, the two developed multiplex assays are suitable for quantification of GMO maize events and the same approach can be used in any other field with a need for accurate and reliable quantification of multiple DNA targets.},

In this first quantitative report of viral enteric pathogens in onsite-collected graywater and wastewater, untreated graywater (n = 50 samples) and combined wastewater (i.e., including blackwater; n = 28) from three decentralized collection systems were analyzed for two norovirus genogroups (GI/GII) and human adenoviruses using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Compared to traditional quantitative PCR (qPCR), which had insufficient sensitivity to quantify viruses in graywater, ddPCR allowed quantification of norovirus GII and adenovirus in 4{\%} and 14{\%} of graywater samples, respectively (none quantifiable for norovirus GI). Norovirus GII was routinely quantifiable in combined wastewater by either PCR method (96{\%} of samples), with well-correlated results between the analyses (R2 = 0.96) indicating a density range of 5.2–7.9 log10 genome copies/L. These concentrations are greater than typically reported in centralized municipal wastewater, yet agree well with an epidemiology-based model previously used to develop pathogen log-reduction targets (LRTs) for decentralized non-potable water systems. Results emphasize the unique quality of onsite wastewaters, supporting the previous LRTs and further quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) of decentralized water reuse.},

abstract = {Introduction: Detection of the JAK2 V617F mutation is a key step in the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Sensitive real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) detection on peripheral blood (PB) is the most widely used method. The main objective of this study was to determine whether serum, the most common material available in archival biobanks, is a good liquid biopsy for detecting and quantifying the JAK2 V617F mutation using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Methods: Paired PB and serum samples from 66 patients with MPN were used. Serum samples were frozen at −25°C before analysis. DNA was extracted from 200 $\mu$L PB and 400 $\mu$L serum, and ddPCR analysis was performed. Results: Among the 47 patients with detectable mutation in their PB samples, the overall sensitivity for the detection of JAK2 mutation in serum was of 96{\%} (45 of 47); V617F was detected in all cases where mutation load was above 1{\%}. Our results showed very strong correlation between PB and serum (Spearman r: 0.989, P {\textless}.0001). Significantly higher allele burden was detected in serum compared to PB (Wilcoxon signed ranks test, Z = −5.672, P {\textless}.0001). Conclusion: In our study, JAK2 V617F mutation load as low as 1{\%} was reliably detected in serum using ddPCR.},

abstract = {Isogenus nubecula is a critically endangered Plecoptera species. Considered extinct in the UK, I. nubecula was recently rediscovered (in one location of the River Dee, Wales), after 22 years of absence. In a similar way to many other species of Perlodidae, I. nubecula could be utilised as a bio-indicator, for assessing water quality and health status of a given freshwater system. However, conventional monitoring of invertebrates via kick-sampling, is invasive and expensive (time consuming). Further, such methods require a high level of taxonomic expertise. Here, we compared the traditional kick-sampling method with the use of eDNA detection using qPCR and ddPCR-analyses. In spring 2018, we sampled eDNA from twelve locations on the River Dee. I. nubecula was detected using kick-sampling in five of these locations, three locations using both eDNA detection and kick-sampling and one location using eDNA detection alone – resulting in a total of six known and distinct populations of this critically endangered species. Interestingly, despite the eDNA assay being validated in vitro and in silico, and results indicating high sensitivity, qPCR analysis of the eDNA samples proved to be ineffective. In contrast, ddPCR analyses resulted in a clear detection of I. nubecula at four locations suggesting that inhibition most likely explains the large discrepancy between the obtained qPCR and ddPCR results. It is therefore important to explore inhibition effects on any new eDNA assay. We also highlight that ddPCR may well be the best option for the detection of aquatic organisms which are either rare or likely to shed low levels of eDNA into their environment.},

abstract = {Digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (dPCR) is a novel method for the absolute quantification of target nucleic acids. Quantification by dPCR hinges on the fact that the random distribution of molecules in many partitions follows a Poisson distribution. Each partition acts as an individual PCR microreactor and partitions containing amplified target sequences are detected by fluorescence. The proportion of PCR-positive partitions suffices to determine the concentration of the target sequence without a need for calibration. Advances in microfluidics enabled the current revolution of digital quantification by providing efficient partitioning methods. In this review, we compare the fundamental concepts behind the quantification of nucleic acids by dPCR and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). We detail the underlying statistics of dPCR and explain how it defines its precision and performance metrics. We review the different microfluidic digital PCR formats, present their underlying physical principles, and analyze the technological evolution of dPCR platforms. We present the novel multiplexing strategies enabled by dPCR and examine how isothermal amplification could be an alternative to PCR in digital assays. Finally, we determine whether the theoretical advantages of dPCR over qPCR hold true by perusing studies that directly compare assays implemented with both methods.},

However, the proposed improvement in sensitivity and reproducibility offered by ddPCR is not yet fully proven, partly because the delineation between positive and negative responses is not always clear.Data are presented demonstrating the sensitivity of the ddPCR system to both reagent concentrations and choice of cut-off for defining positive and negative results. By implementing k-nearest clustering, cut-offs are produced that improve the accuracy of ddPCR where target DNA is present at low copy numbers, a key application of ddPCR. This approach is applied to human albumin and HIV-1 proviral DNA ddPCR quantitative protocols. This tool is coded in JavaScript and has been made available for free in a web browser at http://www.definetherain.org.uk. Optimisation of the analyses of raw ddPCR data using 'definetherain' indicates that low target number detection can be improved by its implementation.

abstract = {Limiting dilution PCR has become an increasingly useful technique for the detection and quantification of rare species in a population, but the limit of detection and accuracy of quantification are largely determined by the number of reactions that can be analyzed. Increased throughput may be achieved by reducing the reaction volume and increasing processivity. We have designed a high-throughput microfluidic chip that encapsulates PCR reagents in millions of picoliter droplets in a continuous oil flow. The oil stream conducts the droplets through alternating denaturation and annealing zones, resulting in rapid (55-s cycles) and efficient PCR amplification. Inclusion of fluorescent probes in the PCR reaction mix permits the amplification process to be monitored within individual droplets at specific locations within the microfluidic chip. We show that amplification of a 245-bp adenovirus product can be detected and quantified in 35 min at starting template concentrations as low as 1 template molecule/167 droplets (0.003 pg/$\mu$L). The frequencies of positive reactions over a range of template concentrations agree closely with the frequencies predicted by Poisson statistics, demonstrating both the accuracy and sensitivity of this platform for limiting dilution and digital PCR applications. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) provides the most sensitive measurement of residual infection in patients on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has recently been shown to provide highly accurate quantification of DNA copy number, but its application to quantification of HIV DNA, or other equally rare targets, has not been reported. This paper demonstrates and analyzes the application of ddPCR to measure the frequency of total HIV DNA (pol copies per million cells), and episomal 2-LTR (long terminal repeat) circles in cells isolated from infected patients. Analysis of over 300 clinical samples, including over 150 clinical samples assayed in triplicate by ddPCR and by real-time PCR (qPCR), demonstrates a significant increase in precision, with an average 5-fold decrease in the coefficient of variation of pol copy numbers and a {\textgreater}20-fold accuracy improvement for 2-LTR circles. Additional benefits of the ddPCR assay over qPCR include absolute quantification without reliance on an external standard and relative insensitivity to mismatches in primer and probe sequences. These features make digital PCR an attractive alternative for measurement of HIV DNA in clinical specimens. The improved sensitivity and precision of measurement of these rare events should facilitate measurements to characterize the latent HIV reservoir and interventions to eradicate it.},

abstract = {Digital PCR (dPCR) is a highly accurate molecular approach, capable of precise measurements, offering a number of unique opportunities. However, in its current format dPCR can be limited by the amount of sample that can be analysed and consequently additional considerations such as performing multiplex reactions or pre-amplification can be considered. This study investigated the impact of duplexing and pre-amplification on dPCR analysis by using three different assays targeting a model template (a portion of the Arabidopsis thaliana alcohol dehydrogenase gene). We also investigated the impact of different template types (linearised plasmid clone and more complex genomic DNA) on measurement precision using dPCR. We were able to demonstrate that duplex dPCR can provide a more precise measurement than uniplex dPCR, while applying pre-amplification or varying template type can significantly decrease the precision of dPCR. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the pre-amplification step can introduce measurement bias that is not consistent between experiments for a sample or assay and so could not be compensated for during the analysis of this data set. We also describe a model for estimating the prevalence of molecular dropout and identify this as a source of dPCR imprecision. Our data have demonstrated that the precision afforded by dPCR at low sample concentration can exceed that of the same template post pre-amplification thereby negating the need for this additional step. Our findings also highlight the technical differences between different templates types containing the same sequence that must be considered if plasmid DNA is to be used to assess or control for more complex templates like genomic DNA. {\textcopyright} 2013 Whale et al.},

abstract = {The growing capacity to process and store animal tracks has spurred the development of new methods to segment animal trajectories into elementary units of movement. Key challenges for movement trajectory segmentation are to (i) minimize the need of supervision, (ii) reduce computational costs, (iii) minimize the need of prior assumptions (e.g. simple parametrizations), and (iv) capture biologically meaningful semantics, useful across a broad range of species. We introduce the Expectation-Maximization binary Clustering (EMbC), a general purpose, unsupervised approach to multivariate data clustering. The EMbC is a variant of the Expectation-Maximization Clustering (EMC), a clustering algorithm based on the maximum likelihood estimation of a Gaussian mixture model. This is an iterative algorithm with a closed form step solution and hence a reasonable computational cost. The method looks for a good compromise between statistical soundness and ease and generality of use (by minimizing prior assumptions and favouring the semantic interpretation of the final clustering). Here we focus on the suitability of the EMbC algorithm for behavioural annotation of movement data. We show and discuss the EMbC outputs in both simulated trajectories and empirical movement trajectories including different species and different tracking methodologies. We use synthetic trajectories to assess the performance of EMbC compared to classic EMC and Hidden Markov Models. Empirical trajectories allow us to explore the robustness of the EMbC to data loss and data inaccuracies, and assess the relationship between EMbC output and expert label assignments. Additionally, we suggest a smoothing procedure to account for temporal correlations among labels, and a proper visualization of the output for movement trajectories. Our algorithm is available as an R-package with a set of complementary functions to ease the analysis.},

abstract = {Background: Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) is an increasingly popular technology for detecting and quantifying target nucleic acids. Its advertised strength is high precision absolute quantification without needing reference curves. The standard data analytic approach follows a seemingly straightforward theoretical framework but ignores sources of variation in the data generating process. These stem from both technical and biological factors, where we distinguish features that are 1) hard-wired in the equipment, 2) user-dependent and 3) provided by manufacturers but may be adapted by the user. The impact of the corresponding variance components on the accuracy and precision of target concentration estimators presented in the literature is studied through simulation.Results: We reveal how system-specific technical factors influence accuracy as well as precision of concentration estimates. We find that a well-chosen sample dilution level and modifiable settings such as the fluorescence cut-off for target copy detection have a substantial impact on reliability and can be adapted to the sample analysed in ways that matter. User-dependent technical variation, including pipette inaccuracy and specific sources of sample heterogeneity, leads to a steep increase in uncertainty of estimated concentrations. Users can discover this through replicate experiments and derived variance estimation. Finally, the detection performance can be improved by optimizing the fluorescence intensity cut point as suboptimal thresholds reduce the accuracy of concentration estimates considerably.Conclusions: Like any other technology, dPCR is subject to variation induced by natural perturbations, systematic settings as well as user-dependent protocols. Corresponding uncertainty may be controlled with an adapted experimental design. Our findings point to modifiable key sources of uncertainty that form an important starting point for the development of guidelines on dPCR design and data analysis with correct precision bounds. Besides clever choices of sample dilution levels, experiment-specific tuning of machine settings can greatly improve results. Well-chosen data-driven fluorescence intensity thresholds in particular result in major improvements in target presence detection. We call on manufacturers to provide sufficiently detailed output data that allows users to maximize the potential of the method in their setting and obtain high precision and accuracy for their experiments.},

abstract = {Here we report on the first assessment of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for detection and absolute quantification of two quarantine plant pathogenic bacteria that infect many species of the Rosaceae and Solanaceae families: Erwinia amylovora and Ralstonia solanacearum. An open-source R script was written for the ddPCR data analysis. Analysis of a set of samples with known health status aided the assessment and selection of different threshold settings (QuantaSoft analysis, definetherain pipeline and manual threshold), which led to optimal diagnostic specificity. The interpretation of the E. amylovora ddPCR was straightforward, and the analysis approach had little influence on the final results and the concentrations determined. The sensitivity and linear range were similar to those for real-time PCR (qPCR), for the analysis of both bacterial suspensions and plant material, making ddPCR a viable choice when both detection and quantification are desired. With the R. solanacearum ddPCR, the use of a high global threshold was necessary to exclude false-positive reactions that are sometimes observed in healthy plant material. ddPCR significantly improved the analytical sensitivity over that of qPCR, and improved the detection of low concentrations of R. solanacearum in potato tuber samples. Accurate and rapid absolute quantification of both of these bacteria in pure culture was achieved by direct ddPCR. Our data confirm the suitability of these ddPCR assays for routine detection and quantification of plant pathogens and for preparation of defined in-house reference materials with known target concentrations.},

While it is known that misclassification has a major impact on the concentration estimate and substantially reduces accuracy, the uncertainty of this classification is typically ignored. We introduce a model-based clustering method to estimate the probability that the target is present (absent) in a partition conditional on its observed fluorescence and the distributional shape in no-template control samples. This methodology acknowledges the inherent uncertainty of the classification and provides a natural measure of precision, both at individual partition level and at the level of the global concentration. We illustrate our method on genetically modified organism, inhibition, dynamic range, and mutation detection experiments. We show that our method provides concentration estimates of similar accuracy or better than the current standard, along with a more realistic measure of precision. The individual partition probabilities and diagnostic density plots further allow for some quality control. An R implementation of our method, called Umbrella, is available, providing a more objective and automated data analysis procedure for absolute dPCR quantification.},

However, the first generation of platforms still needs careful validation and requires a specificmethodology for data analysis to distinguish negative from positive signals by defining a threshold value. The currently described methods to assess droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) are based on an underlying assumption that the fluorescent signal of droplets is normally distributed. We show that this normality assumption does not likely hold true for most ddPCR runs, resulting in an erroneous threshold. We suggest a methodology that does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the fluorescence readouts. A threshold is estimated by modelling the extreme values in the negative droplet population using extreme value theory. Furthermore, the method takes shifts in baseline fluorescence between samples into account.

@article{Wilson2016,
abstract = {Background: Digital PCR (dPCR) is a technique for estimating the concentration of a target nucleic acid by loading a sample into a large number of partitions, amplifying the target and using a fluorescent marker to identify which partitions contain the target. The standard analysis uses only the proportion of partitions containing target to estimate the concentration and depends on the assumption that the initial distribution of molecules in partitions is Poisson. In this paper we describe a way to extend such analysis using the quantification cycle (Cq) data that may also be available, but rather than assuming the Poisson distribution the more general Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution is used instead. Results: A software package for the open source language R has been created for performing the analysis. This was used to validate the method by analysing Cq data from dPCR experiments involving 3 types of DNA (attenuated, virulent and plasmid) at 3 concentrations. Results indicate some deviation from the Poisson distribution, which is strongest for the virulent DNA sample. Theoretical calculations indicate that the deviation from the Poisson distribution results in a bias of around 5 {\%} for the analysed data if the standard analysis is used, but that it could be larger for higher concentrations. Compared to the estimates of subsequent efficiency, the estimates of 1st cycle efficiency are much lower for the virulent DNA, moderately lower for the attenuated DNA and close for the plasmid DNA. Further method validation using simulated data gave results closer to the true values and with lower standard deviations than the standard method, for concentrations up to approximately 2.5 copies/partition. Conclusions: The Cq-based method is effective at estimating DNA concentration and is not seriously affected by data issues such as outliers and moderately non-linear trends. The data analysis suggests that the Poisson assumption of the standard approach does lead to a bias that is fairly small, though more research is needed. Estimates of the 1st cycle efficiency being lower than estimates of the subsequent efficiency may indicate samples that are mixtures of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. The model can reduce or eliminate the resulting bias.},

However, currently reported or commercial dPCR devices are not suitable for applications in laboratories or zones with limited infrastructures, due to low function integration, cost-inefficiency, or weak mobility. Herein, in order to enable accurate DNA quantitative analysis in such situations, we have developed a smartphone-based mobile dPCR device integrated with thermal cycling control, on-chip dPCR, data acquisition, and result analysis. All the function units are automatically controlled using a customized Android software. The device is approximately 90 mm × 90 mm × 100 mm in size and about 500 g in weight, only costing about 320 dollars except the smartphone. Coupled with the self-priming dPCR chip previously developed by our lab, the device is able to accurately quantify down to 10 copies of the human 18 S ribosomal DNA fragment inserted in a plasmid. Comparing to the commercial QuantStudio™ 3D dPCR platform, our device achieves a comparable analytical accuracy. Besides, our device is capable of detecting single molecule of cancer biomarker gene CD147 in a low number of HepG2 cells. Therefore, our dPCR device as a low-cost, potable, and robust tool for highly accurate DNA quantitative analysis has a great potential in Point-of-care (POC) applications.},
