abstract = {The problem of temporal data clustering is addressed using a dynamic Gaussian mixture model. In addition to the missing clusters used in the classical Gaussian mixture model, the proposed approach assumes that the means of the Gaussian densities are latent variables distributed according to random walks. The parameters of the proposed algorithm are estimated by the maximum likelihood approach. However, the EM algorithm cannot be applied directly due to the complex structure of the model, and some approximations are required. Using a variational approximation, an algorithm called VEM-DyMix is proposed to estimate the parameters of the proposed model. Using simulated data, the ability of the proposed approach to accurately estimate the parameters is demonstrated. VEM-DyMix outperforms, in terms of clustering and estimation accuracy, other state-of-the-art algorithms. The experiments performed on real world data from two fields of application (railway condition monitoring and object tracking from videos) show the strong potential of the proposed algorithms.},

@article{Bi2017,
abstract = {With the development of computer network bandwidth, packet classification algorithms which are able to deal with large-scale rule sets are in urgent need. Among the existing algorithms, researches on packet classification algorithms based on hierarchical trie have become an important packet classification research branch because of their widely practical use. Although hierarchical trie is beneficial to save large storage space, it has several shortcomings such as the existence of backtracking and empty nodes. This paper proposes a new packet classification algorithm, Hierarchical Trie Algorithm Based on Expectation-Maximization Clustering (HTEMC). Firstly, this paper uses the formalization method to deal with the packet classification problem by means of mapping the rules and data packets into a two-dimensional space. Secondly, this paper uses expectation-maximization algorithm to cluster the rules based on their aggregate characteristics, and thereby diversified clusters are formed. Thirdly, this paper proposes a hierarchical trie based on the results of expectation-maximization clustering. Finally, this paper respectively conducts simulation experiments and real-environment experiments to compare the performances of our algorithm with other typical algorithms, and analyzes the results of the experiments. The hierarchical trie structure in our algorithm not only adopts trie path compression to eliminate backtracking, but also solves the problem of low efficiency of trie updates, which greatly improves the performance of the algorithm.},

    abstract = "{A generalisation of the ecm algorithm (Meng \\&amp; Rubin, 1993), which is itself an extension of the em algorithm (Dempster, Laird \\&amp; Rubin, 1977), can be obtained by replacing some CM-steps of ECM, which maximise the constrained expected complete-data loglikelihood function, with steps that maximise the correspondingly constrained actual likelihood function. This algorithm, which we call ecme algorithm, for Expectation/Conditional Maximisation Either, shares with both em and ecm their stable monotone convergence and basic simplicity of implementation relative to competing faster converging methods. Moreover, ecme can have a substantially faster convergence rate than either EM or ECM, measured using either the number of iterations or actual computer time. There are two reasons for this improvement. First, in some of ECME'S maximisation steps, the actual likelihood is being conditionally maximised, rather than a current approximation to it, as with EM and ECM. Secondly, ecme allows faster converging numerical methods to be used on only those constrained maximisations where they are most efficacious. Illustrative ecme algorithms are presented with both closed-form and iterative CM-steps, which demonstrate the faster rate of convergence and the associated easier assessment of convergence. Also, theoretical expressions are presented and illustrated regarding the rate of convergence of ecme. Finally, relationships with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are discussed.}",

 abstract = {Linear mixed models with normally distributed response are routinely used in longitudinal data. However, the accuracy of the assumed normal distribution is crucial for valid inference of the parameters. We present a new class of asymmetric linear mixed models that provides for an efficient estimation of the parameters in the analysis of longitudinal data. We assume that, marginally, the random effects follow a multivariate skew-normal/independent distribution (Branco and Dey (2001)) and that the random errors follow a symmetric normal/independent distribution (Lange and Sinsheimer (1993)), providing an appealing robust alternative to the usual symmetric normal distribution in linear mixed models. Specific distributions examined include the skew-normal, the skew-t, the skew-slash, and the skew-contaminated normal distribution. We present an efficient EM-type algorithm for the computation of maximum likelihood estimation of parameters. The technique for the prediction of future responses under this class of distributions is also investigated. The methodology is illustrated through an application to Framingham cholesterol data and a simulation study.},
