abstract = {This paper proposes a novel fuzzy model-based unsupervised learning algorithm with boundary correction for image segmentation. We propose a fuzzy Generalized Gaussian Density (GGD) segmentation model and the GGD-based agglomerative fuzzy algorithm for grouping image pixels. The merits of algorithm are that it is not sensitive to initial parameters and that the number of groups can be estimated via the validation technique. To minimize the objective function of the model, we define a dissimilarity measure based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence of the GGDs that computes the discrepancy between GGDs in the space of generalized probability distributions. To effectively segment images with various textures, we propose a two-stage fuzzy GGD segmentation algorithm. The first stage adopts the proposed fuzzy algorithm to obtain initial segmentation and the second stage improves initial segmentation by image boundary correction. Experimental results show that our proposed method has a promising performance compared with existing approaches.},

abstract = {Model-based clustering assumes that the data observed can be represented by a finite mixture model, where each cluster is represented by a parametric distribution. The Gaussian distribution is often employed in the multivariate continuous case. The identification of the subset of relevant clustering variables enables a parsimonious number of unknown parameters to be achieved, thus yielding a more efficient estimate, a clearer interpretation and often improved clustering partitions. This paper discusses variable or feature selection for model- based clustering. Following the approach of Raftery and Dean (J Am Stat Assoc 101(473):168–178, 2006), the problem of subset selection is recast as a model comparison problem, and BIC is used to approximate Bayes factors. The criterion proposed is based on the BIC difference between a candidate clustering model for the given subset and a model which assumes no clustering for the same subset. Thus, the problem amounts to finding the feature subset which maximises such a criterion. A search over the potentially vast solution space is performed using genetic algorithms, which are stochastic search algorithms that use techniques and concepts inspired by evolutionary biology and natural selection. Numerical experiments using real data applications are presented and discussed.},

abstract = {Identifying differentially variable (DV) genomic probes is becoming a new approach to detect novel genomic risk factors for complex human diseases. The F test is the standard equal-variance test in statistics. For high-throughput genomic data, the probe-wise F test has been successfully used to detect biologically relevant DNA methylation marks that have different variances between two groups of subjects (e.g., cases versus controls). In addition to DNA methylation, microRNA (miRNA) is another important mechanism of epigenetics. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have identified DV miRNAs. In this article, we proposed a novel model-based clustering method to improve the power of the probe-wise F test to detect DV miRNAs. We imposed special structures on covariance matrices for each cluster of miRNAs based on the prior information about the relationship between variances in cases and controls and about the independence among them. Simulation studies showed that the proposed method seems promising in detecting DV probes. Based on two real datasets about human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we identified 7 DV-only miRNAs (hsa-miR-1826, hsa-miR-191, hsa-miR-194-star, hsa-miR-222, hsa-miR-502-3p, hsa-miR-93, and hsa-miR-99b) using the proposed method, one (hsa-miR-1826) of which has not yet been reported to be related to HCC in the literature.},

abstract = {The majority of model-based clustering techniques is based on multivariate normal models and their variants. In this paper copulas are used for the construction of flexible families of models for clustering applications. The use of copulas in model-based clustering offers two direct advantages over current methods: (i) the appropriate choice of copulas provides the ability to obtain a range of exotic shapes for the clusters, and (ii) the explicit choice of marginal distributions for the clusters allows the modelling of multivariate data of various modes (either discrete or continuous) in a natural way. This paper introduces and studies the framework of copula-based finite mixture models for clustering applications. Estimation in the general case can be performed using standard EM, and, depending on the mode of the data, more efficient procedures are provided that can fully exploit the copula structure. The closure properties of the mixture models under marginalization are discussed, and for continuous, real-valued data parametric rotations in the sample space are introduced, with a parallel discussion on parameter identifiability depending on the choice of copulas for the components. The exposition of the methodology is accompanied and motivated by the analysis of real and artificial data.},

abstract = {A pervasive challenge in microbial ecology is understanding the genetic level where ecological units can be differentiated. Ecological differentiation often occurs at fine genomic levels, yet it is unclear how to utilise ecological information to define ecotypes given the breadth of environmental variation among microbial taxa. Here, we present an analytical framework that infers clusters along genome-based microbial phylogenies according to shared environmental responses. The advantage of our approach is the ability to identify genomic clusters that best fit complex environmental information whilst characterising cluster niches through model predictions. We apply our method to determine climate-associated ecotypes in populations of nitrogen-fixing symbionts using whole genomes, explicitly sampled to detect climate differentiation across a heterogeneous landscape. Although soil and plant host characteristics strongly influence distribution patterns of inferred ecotypes, our flexible statistical method enabled us to identify climate-associated genomic clusters using environmental data, providing solid support for ecological specialisation in soil symbionts.},
