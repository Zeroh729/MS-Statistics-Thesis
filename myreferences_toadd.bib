@article{ElAssaad2016,
abstract = {The problem of temporal data clustering is addressed using a dynamic Gaussian mixture model. In addition to the missing clusters used in the classical Gaussian mixture model, the proposed approach assumes that the means of the Gaussian densities are latent variables distributed according to random walks. The parameters of the proposed algorithm are estimated by the maximum likelihood approach. However, the EM algorithm cannot be applied directly due to the complex structure of the model, and some approximations are required. Using a variational approximation, an algorithm called VEM-DyMix is proposed to estimate the parameters of the proposed model. Using simulated data, the ability of the proposed approach to accurately estimate the parameters is demonstrated. VEM-DyMix outperforms, in terms of clustering and estimation accuracy, other state-of-the-art algorithms. The experiments performed on real world data from two fields of application (railway condition monitoring and object tracking from videos) show the strong potential of the proposed algorithms.},

@article{Bi2017,
abstract = {With the development of computer network bandwidth, packet classification algorithms which are able to deal with large-scale rule sets are in urgent need. Among the existing algorithms, researches on packet classification algorithms based on hierarchical trie have become an important packet classification research branch because of their widely practical use. Although hierarchical trie is beneficial to save large storage space, it has several shortcomings such as the existence of backtracking and empty nodes. This paper proposes a new packet classification algorithm, Hierarchical Trie Algorithm Based on Expectation-Maximization Clustering (HTEMC). Firstly, this paper uses the formalization method to deal with the packet classification problem by means of mapping the rules and data packets into a two-dimensional space. Secondly, this paper uses expectation-maximization algorithm to cluster the rules based on their aggregate characteristics, and thereby diversified clusters are formed. Thirdly, this paper proposes a hierarchical trie based on the results of expectation-maximization clustering. Finally, this paper respectively conducts simulation experiments and real-environment experiments to compare the performances of our algorithm with other typical algorithms, and analyzes the results of the experiments. The hierarchical trie structure in our algorithm not only adopts trie path compression to eliminate backtracking, but also solves the problem of low efficiency of trie updates, which greatly improves the performance of the algorithm.},
