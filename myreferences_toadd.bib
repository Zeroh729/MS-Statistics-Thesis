abstract = {Climate classification aims to divide a given region into distinct groups on the basis of meteorological variables, and it has important applications in fields such as agriculture and buildings. In this paper, we propose a novel spectral clustering-based method to partition 661 meteorological stations in China into several zones. First, the correlations are analyzed among five meteorological variables: daily average temperature, average relative humidity, sunshine hours, diurnal temperature range, and atmospheric pressure. The resulting weak linear correlation supports the classification under multiple views. Next, a similarity matrix/graph is constructed by combining the advantages of k-nearest-neighbor and sparse subspace representation. The blocking effect of the similarity matrix confirms the rationality of the classification. Then, we consider respectively the climate classification under a single view and multiple views. For the single view, atmospheric pressure has the highest imbalance degree, and sunshine hours and diurnal temperature range have the strongest classification consistency. The consistency rates are improved evidently in a multiple-view situation. Afterward, we propose a determining method for the number of clusters and make a sensitivity analysis on various parameters. Finally, we provide a further statistical analysis on the classification results and compare the consistency with another climate dataset. All experimental results show that the proposed classification method is feasible and effective in the climate zoning of China.},

abstract = {In the field of Artificial Intelligence Machine learning provides the automatic systems which learn and improve itself from experience without being explicitly programmed. In this research work a movie recommender system is built using the K-Means Clustering and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms. The movielens dataset is taken from kaggle. The system is implemented in python programming language. The proposed work deals with the introduction of various concepts related to machine learning and recommendation system. In this work, various tools and techniques have been used to build recommender systems. Various algorithms such as K-Means Clustering, KNN, Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering have been described in detail. Further, after studying different types of machine learning algorithms, there is a clear picture of where to apply which algorithm in different areas of industries such as recommender systems, e-commerce, etc. Then there is an illustration of how implementations and working of the proposed system are used for the implementation of the movie recommender system. Various building blocks of the proposed system such as Architecture, Process Flow, Pseudo Code, Implementation and Working of the System is described in detail. Finally, in this work for different cluster values, different values of Root Mean Squared Error are obtained. In this proposed work as the no of clusters decreases, the value of RMSE also decreases. The best value of RMSE obtained is 1.081648. The results given by the proposed system are better than the existing technique on the basis of RMSE value.},
